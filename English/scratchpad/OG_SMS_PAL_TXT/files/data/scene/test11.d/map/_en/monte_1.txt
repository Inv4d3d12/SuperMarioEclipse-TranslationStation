	+ put together!\n
	+ When it's chained up\n
	+ there's no problem,\n
	+ of course, but...\n
	+ When that thing's\n
	+ loose, we're in a heap\n
	+ of trouble. Oh, yes!\n
	+ That beast's owner\n
	+ always has burnt\n

	+ Well, let's just say it\n
	+ looks bad, and it\n
	+ gave us a bad rep.\n
	+ It's just as pure as\n
	+ the spring water, and\n
	+ it's good for you...\n
	+ Well, it goes to show\n
