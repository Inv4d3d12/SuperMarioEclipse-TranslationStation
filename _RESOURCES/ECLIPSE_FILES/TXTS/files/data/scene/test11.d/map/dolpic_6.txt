     0 [/5] = I saw a boat in\n
	+ the distance. Wonder\n
	+ where it goes?
     1 [/8] = Master Mario! Have\n
	+ you seen the\n
	+ message updates?\n
	+ They're from the\n
	+ Delfino Emergency\n
	+ Broadcast System.\n
	+ They'll tell you\n
	+ what's happening\n
	+ on the island!
     2	= According to the\n
	+ guidebook, this area\n
	+ has a... \n
	+ I can't believe it!\n
	+ An amusement park!!\n
	+ How incredibly cool!\n
	+ It's on the island\n
	+ visible from the\n
	+ western boathouse!
     3	= The Shine Gate's to\n
	+ the north, and the\n
	+ lighthouse is east.\n
	+ The boathouse is\n
	+ to the west, and\n
	+ we're down south.\n
	+ You can press the\n
	+ Z Button to view\n
	+ the guidebook map!
     4 [/10] = The man that took\n
	+ the princess had\n
	+ some kind of brush.\n
	+ Is that what he\n
	+ uses to draw\n
	+ graffiti, you think?
     5	= Mario! Are you used\n
	+ to using that FLUDD\n
	+ thing now?\n
	+ You can also switch\n
	+ it to a hover device\n
	+ with the X Button!
     6	= A long time ago,\n
	+ Yoshis lived on this\n
	+ island as well.
     7 [/15] = Hey! Are you\n
	+ slacking off!?
     8 [/15] = And clean up\n
	+ those walls!!\n
	+ Now, slacker!
     9 [/16] = This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     a [/17] = It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     b [/17] = It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     c [/17] = I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     d [/25] = Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     e [/4c] = Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     f [/20] = What's that?\n
	+ Hold on!\n
	+ I smell it!\n
	+ Something's going to\n
	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
    10 [/19] = It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are all cities dark?
    11 [/4a] = Now where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    12 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    13 [/16] = I still wish the sun\n
	+ would return, but\n
	+ who needs a tan?
    14 [/15] = So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    15 [/1d] = You know, you have\n
	+ a pretty suspicious\n
	+ mustache there.\n
	+ I bet we're in this\n
	+ fix because of a\n
	+ mustache like that!\n
	+ And this haze! I bet\n
	+ it's 'cause the Shine\n
	+ Sprites are all gone!
    16 [/1d] = You lost our crate-\n
	+ bashing duel fair\n
	+ and square!\n
	+ You're just a\n
	+ squid-brained sore\n
	+ loser, that's all!\n
	+ And Shine Sprites\n
	+ don't like sore losers!\n
	+ Squid-for-brains!
    17 [/21] = The boat has finally\n
	+ begun moving again!
    18 [/16] = These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...
    19 [/14] = I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
