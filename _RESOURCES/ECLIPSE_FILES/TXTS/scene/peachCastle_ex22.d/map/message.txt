	+ Welcome to Isle\n
	+ Meduse,\n
	+ Home of the largest\n

     1 [/3b] = Fifteen years I've been\n
	+ working here. It's hard work,\n
	+ but it really pays off after\n
	+ a job well done. What do I\n
	+ do, you ask? Why, isn't it\n
	+ obvious? How do you think\n
	+ the beach is so smooth? I\n
	+ brush it, of course! From\n
	+ sunrise to sunset, theres no\n
	+ rest for a humble beach sweeper.\n
	+ Except during my break.\n
	+ Like right now.
     2	= Ya know, sometimes\n
	+ I wonder what it would\n
	+ be like on those other\n
	+ islands out there. Eh,\n
	+ I bet it would be boring.\n
	+ What could they even\n
	+ have? Not like there's\n
	+ any sort of grand adventure\n
	+ out there.
     3	= Have you heard this idiot?\n
	+ He's spouting nonsense, I'll\n
	+ tell ya! The nerve of this guy!

     a	= Where have my sweet\n
	+ little boy gone? I haven't\n
	+ seen him all day\n
	+ He's old enough to be\n
	+ on his own, but I just\n
	+ get so worried.\n
	+ Excuse me sir, could\n
	+ you find him and bring\n
	+ him back to me?\n
	+ I know it sounds a little\n
	+ strange but you would\n
	+ be rewarded.
     b	= You're saying my mom\n

    10	= Thank you so much!\n
	+ Please, take this! It's\n
	+ the least I could do.
    11 [/45] = It's you! I can't belive\n
	+ it's really...Oh.\n
	+ You're not Wario.\n
	+ Begone, I'm not\n
	+ interested in talking to\n
	+ Wario knockoffs.
    12 [/47] = Where art thou, my\n
	+ yellow prince? I wish\n
	+ to shower you in love!\n
	+ I would never have a\n
	+ rotten day, as long as\n
	+ you were around.

	+ it out at some point!
    15	= Hey girl, you hear\n
	+ about pluto? Thats\n
	+ messed up, right?
    16	= This guy has been standing here\n
	+ repeating that line every time I\n
	+ look his direction. I keep\n
	+ pretending like I don't actually\n
	+ notice him so he looks away\n
	+ quickly and acts like he didnt\n
	+ say anything until I glance\n
	+ his way again.\n
	+ This might be the worst\n
	+ day of my life.
    17	= Don't worry about me, I'm fine.\n
	+ I heard from a long distance\n
	+ friend that running like youre\n
	+ on fire helps the hamstrings\n
	+ loosen up! I sure do feel the\n
	+ burn though, huhuhu!
