	+ We've got another\n

	+ put together!\n
	+ When it's chained up\n
	+ there's no problem,\n
	+ of course, but...\n
	+ When that thing's\n
	+ loose, we're in a heap\n
	+ of trouble. Oh, yes!\n

	+ and me, but the water\n
	+ for the hot spring...\n
	+ It pours out of that\n
	+ big plant over there,\n
	+ right? And it looks...\n
	+ Well, let's just say it\n
	+ looks bad, and it\n
	+ gave us a bad rep.\n
	+ It's just as pure as\n
	+ the spring water, and\n
	+ it's good for you...\n
	+ Well, it goes to show\n
	+ you the importance of\n
	+ appearances, I guess.\n
