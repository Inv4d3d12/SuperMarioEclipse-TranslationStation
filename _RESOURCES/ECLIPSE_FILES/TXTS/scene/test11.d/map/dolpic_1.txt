	+ that way!
     7 [/15] = Hey! Are you\n
	+ slacking off!?
     8 [/15] = And clean up\n
	+ those walls!!\n
	+ Now, slacker!
     9 [/1a] = This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     a [/17] = It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     b [/17] = It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     c [/17] = I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     d [/4f] = Running around and\n

	+ sweaty! Yes, sir!
     e [/49] = I heard more cries\n

	+ there yet? Huh?\n
	+ My, how exciting!
    10 [/18] = So, this is the\n
	+ Grand Pianta!\n
	+ How...striking!\n
	+ Where did it come\n
	+ from? Talk about\n
	+ a dramatic entrance!
    11 [/4f] = This is the\n
	+ Grand Pianta?\n
	+ \n
	+ Pshaw! What's so\n
	+ great about it?\n
	+ It's just...a rock.
    12 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    13 [/1a] = So, it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n
	+ I just wish the sun\n
	+ would return and\n
	+ tan us like before!
    14 [/1f] = Well, hello there!\n
	+ I'm what you might\n
	+ call the crate guy!\n
	+ The crates come in\n
	+ off the boats, and\n
	+ I deal with 'em.\n
	+ You look like you\n

	+ If you've got free\n
	+ time, why don't you\n
	+ try bashing some?\n
    15 [/15] = Hey there! You\n
	+ don't look so good.\n
	+ It's like, well...\n
	+ It's like disaster is\n
	+ written all over your\n
	+ face, you know?\n
	+ What's that?! We're\n
	+ already having a\n
	+ disaster?! Oh...right!
    16 [/1b] = We're in a tight\n
	+ spot, and that's\n
	+ for sure!\n
	+ I'm telling you,\n
	+ this place will be\n
	+ pitch-black soon!
    17 [/1c] = I guess it's true\n
	+ about the Shine\n
	+ Sprites leaving...
    18 [/14] = Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    19 [/16] = These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...

	+ \n
	+ Please come again.\n
    1c [/14] = I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
    1d [/84] = Ow ow ow OW!\n
	+ Not fair!\n
	+ Completely unfair!\n

	+ tools like that!
