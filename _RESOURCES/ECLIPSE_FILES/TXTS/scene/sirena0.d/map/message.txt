     0	= Oh, please tell me\n
	+ my nightmare is over!\n
	+ You can save me!\n
	+ I don't know why, but\n
	+ you just look very...\n
	+ capable to me.\n
	+ Listen...it all started\n
	+ around noon. This\n
	+ giant manta-shaped...\n
	+ ...thing showed up. It\n
	+ was this paper-thin...\n
	+ floating silhouette.\n
	+ It came and covered\n
	+ the hotel grounds in\n
	+ this electric goop.\n
	+ Then... Oh, the horror!\n
	+ My beautiful hotel!\n
	+ My poor building!\n
	+ It sank in the middle\n
	+ of that awful ooze!\n
	+ Why me? WHY???\n
	+ Now, I've got the staff\n
	+ cleaning up, but\n
	+ where's my hotel?\n
	+ What am I supposed\n
	+ to do? I can't just\n
	+ sit back and...\n
	+ AIIIIGH! It's back!\n
	+ That gossamer ghoul!\n
	+ Do something!
     1 [/2b] = What a cool-looking\n
	+ sunset. Spectacular!
     2 [/34] = I heard this is a\n
	+ great hotel! I can't\n
	+ wait to see my room.
     3 [/2c] = Awwwwwwww...\n
	+ I must have the worst\n
	+ luck in the world...\n
	+ Oh, well! Looks like\n
	+ another night of\n
	+ camping on the beach.
     4 [/36] = I wonder if this\n
	+ fellow can truly\n
	+ make me happy...
     5 [/1d] = Wha...what? WHAT?\n
	+ The hotel's vanished?\n
	+ What does that mean?
     6 [/4d] = Hey! What's going on!\n
	+ What's this nonsense?\n
	+ You! Fix it! Now!
     7	= Hmph! I guess I'd\n
	+ better start looking\n
	+ for a new job, huh?
     8 [/1c] = My other pants were\n
	+ in my locker. Now, the\n
	+ whole hotel's gone!
     9 [/18] = Fantastic!\n
	+ You're amazing!\n
	+ You're my hero!\n
	+ I was just flapping\n
	+ my gums about getting\n
	+ rid of that thing...\n
	+ I didn't believe\n
	+ you'd actually do it!
     a [/27] = OK, then. I guess\n
	+ it's about time\n
	+ to check in.
     b [/32] = How romantic...\n
	+ Tee hee!
     c [/27] = Well, who knows?\n
	+ Maybe my luck's\n
	+ beginning to turn...
     d [/30] = I actually think I\n
	+ see a ray of hope...
     e [/1d] = Wha...what? The\n
	+ hotel's back?\n
	+ This is just crazy!
     f [/4d] = Hey! What is this?\n
	+ Is this a prank?\n
	+ Don't try to fool me!
    10 [/21] = Oh, this is great!\n
	+ Thanks to you, I've\n
	+ still got a job!
    11 [/20] = I hope my pants\n
	+ survived the\n
	+ ordeal intact...
    12 [/26] = I don't know why, but\n
	+ this was a safe place\n
	+ when the goop fell...
    13 [/21] = I was under the roof,\n
	+ so I didn't get\n
	+ drenched in slime.
