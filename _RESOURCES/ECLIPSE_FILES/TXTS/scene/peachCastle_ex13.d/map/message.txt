     0 [/7] = M-M-Master Mario!\n
	+ The p-p-princess!
     1	= Tourists seem to\n
	+ arrive on the daily.\n
	+ \n
	+ I really don't mind\n
	+ their presence, but I\n
	+ worry for the mayor.\n
	+ He's become\n
	+ obsessed with getting\n
	+ five star ratings.\n
	+ I hope he doesn't\n
	+ sacrifice the historic\n
	+ integrity of the island.
     2 [/15] = Ol' reliable here has\n
	+ been blowing in the\n
	+ breeze for ages.\n
	+ But the old wooden\n
	+ parts are finally\n
	+ breaking down.\n
	+ I hate to see it go,\n
	+ but our community\n
	+ relies on wind power.\n
	+ We need that new\n
	+ windmill as soon as\n
	+ possible, heh.
     3	= These rolling hills\n
	+ tend to stay\n
	+ pretty sleepy.\n
	+ I hear the town\n
	+ nearby has some\n
	+ renovation plans.\n
	+ I suppose we'll\n
	+ eventually expand\n
	+ across the hillside.\n
	+ Too bad, honestly.\n
	+ I enjoy the peace.
     4 [/15] = Looking to\n
	+ head back to\n
	+ Dolpic Town?\n
	+ Just pass right\n
	+ through here.\n
	+ Safe travels!
     5 [/2] = Humph!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ My darling Nico\n
	+ wanted to stay in\n
	+ that filthy town!\n
	+ I sent her father\n
	+ to retrieve her, but\n
	+ he's wandered off.\n
	+ What a day!
     6 [/20] = Do ya hear the\n
	+ loud stomping just\n
	+ up the hill?\n
	+ Those horrible\n
	+ creatures just showed\n
	+ up outta nowhere!\n
	+ Could ya be a pal\n
	+ and help us get\n
	+ rid of 'em?
     7 [/15] = And clean up\n
	+ those walls!!\n
	+ Now, slacker!
     8 [/16] = This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     9	= It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     a	= It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     b	= I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     c [/25] = Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     d [/4c] = Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     e [/20] = What's that?\n
	+ Hold on!\n
	+ I smell it!\n
	+ Something's going to\n
	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
     f [/19] = It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are all cities dark?
    10 [/4a] = Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    11 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    12 [/16] = I still wish the sun\n
	+ would return, but\n
	+ who needs a tan?
    13 [/15] = So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    14 [/1d] = Don't get all high and\n
	+ mighty with me! You\n
	+ swim like a stone!
    15 [/1d] = Back off! I know for\n
	+ a fact that you can't\n
	+ swim a stroke, either!
    16 [/21] = The boat's finally\n
	+ moving again!
    17 [/16] = These repairs are\n
	+ still baking my\n
	+ noodle, I tell you!
    18 [/14] = I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
