     0 [0] = Welcome back!\n
	+ I'm so glad you're\n
	+ safe!\n
	+ This vacation's just\n
	+ been a whirlwind of\n
	+ bizarre events, huh?\n
	+ And now, the boat\n
	+ to the hotel isn't\n
	+ even running!\n
	+ Toadsworth and the\n
	+ others already went\n
	+ ahead.\n
	+ I'm going to explore\n
	+ around town for a\n
	+ while and wait.\n
	+ So why don't you\n
	+ take some time to\n
	+ see the island sights?
     1 [/6] = This island seems\n
	+ to be the victim of\n
	+ a bad turn of fate!\n
	+ Oh my, yes...
     2 [/11] = I saw it with my\n
	+ own eyes! The man\n
	+ who took the\n
	+ princess was using\n
	+ a brush to draw\n
	+ graffiti! I saw it!
     3 [/10] = I heard this was a\n
	+ sun-splashed isle,\n
	+ but it sure is dark!\n
	+ Is it because they've\n
	+ lost their so-called\n
	+ "Shine Sprites"?
     4	= Everyone on this\n
	+ isle loves to do\n
	+ the "box-breaker"!\n
	+ Just jump up and\n
	+ press the L Button\n
	+ above a box!\n
	+ Ka-SMASH!\n
	+ Why don't you give\n
	+ it a try?
     5 [/10] = Are you used\n
	+ to using that FLUDD\n
	+ thing now?\n
	+ You can also switch\n
	+ it to a hover device\n
	+ with the X Button!
     6	= A long time ago,\n
	+ Yoshis lived on this\n
	+ island as well.
     7 [/15] = Hey! Are you\n
	+ slacking off!?
     8 [/15] = And clean up those\n
	+ walls, slacker!
     9 [/1a] = This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     a [/17] = It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     b [/17] = It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     c [/17] = I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     d [/25] = Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     e [/4c] = Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     f [/1c] = When are we going\n
	+ to have another\n
	+ scandalous incident?\n
	+ I'm so bored.\n
	+ Nothing fun ever\n
	+ happens here.
    10 [/19] = It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this daytime?\n
	+ \n
	+ I guess cities are\n
	+ just dark all the\n
	+ time, huh?
    11 [/4a] = Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    12 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    13 [/16] = So, it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n
	+ I just wish the sun\n
	+ would return and\n
	+ tan us like before!
    14 [/15] = So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    15 [/1d] = That's hogwash!\n
	+ Your ancestors were\n
	+ all hairdressers!\n
	+ You liar!
    16 [/1d] = I'm not lying!\n
	+ I even saw the\n
	+ plans for it!\n
	+ You're just not\n
	+ listening to me, you\n
	+ pickled squid-brain!
    17 [/14] = Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    18 [/14] = These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...
    19 [/14] = I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
    1a [/2] = Oh, I'm getting that\n
	+ feeling again.\n
	+ This is not good.\n
	+ Has something bad\n
	+ happened again?\n
	+ It feels like it!\n
	+ Please check\n
	+ it out for me...
    1b [/8] = Master Mario! Have\n
	+ you seen the\n
	+ message updates?\n
	+ They're from the\n
	+ Delfino Emergency\n
	+ Broadcast System.\n
	+ They'll tell you\n
	+ what's happening\n
	+ on the island!
    1c [/11] = I saw it with my\n
	+ own eyes! The man\n
	+ who took the\n
	+ princess was using\n
	+ a brush to draw\n
	+ graffiti! I saw it!
    1d	= The Shine Gate's to\n
	+ the north, and the\n
	+ lighthouse is east.\n
	+ The boathouse is\n
	+ to the west, and\n
	+ we're down south.
    1e	= Everyone on this\n
	+ isle loves to do\n
	+ the "box-breaker"!\n
	+ Just jump up and\n
	+ press the L Button\n
	+ above a box!\n
	+ Ka-SMASH!\n
