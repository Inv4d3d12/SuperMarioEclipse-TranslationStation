	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n

	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    11 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n

	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
