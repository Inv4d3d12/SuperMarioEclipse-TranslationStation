	+ creature I s-saw...\n
	+ You stole my\n
	+ f-favorite jar!\n
	+ \n
	+ Get back heerrrreee!!!
     1 [/26] = Heeheehee!!!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ These special glowy\n
	+ mushrooms taste\n
	+ sooooo good!!\n
	+ And they're mine-\n
	+ aaaallll MINE!\n
	+ Ahehehehehaaaaa!!\n
	+ I j-just wish the pretty\n
	+ rainbow animals would\n
	+ g-go somewhere else...
     2 [/1d] = ALL HAIL THE GREAT\n
	+ SHINE SPRITE!!\n
	+ Hakuna-ma-ka-haa...\n
	+ THE GREAT SHINE\n
	+ SPRITE GIVES US\n
	+ WARMTH AND LIGHT!\n
	+ FOOLISH MORTAL-\n
	+ YOU CANNOT SUBDUE\n
	+ THE POWERFUL SHINE.
     3 [/1c] = Well, after getting\n
	+ stuck down here, I've\n
	+ got a crisis...\n
	+ I can't watch all the\n
	+ new episodes of my\n
	+ favorite TV show!\n
	+ They were just about to\n
	+ air the season finale\n
	+ but I missed it! Humph!\n
	+ One of these days, I'm\n
	+ going to climb out of\n
	+ this pit...\n
	+ ...and finally achieve\n
	+ my dream of becoming\n
	+ a big TV superstar!\n
	+ Then everyone will have\n
	+ a TV to watch my show\n
	+ on. Even down here!\n
	+ Dunno how I'll do it...\n
	+ but just you wait and\n
	+ see- haha!
     4	= My brother just outside\n
	+ wants to be on TV.\n
	+ \n
	+ He always talks big\n
	+ game about sweeping\n
	+ from coast to coast.\n
	+ One time he said he\n
	+ was offered a spot on\n
	+ our tourist commercial.\n
	+ You know the one...\n
	+ "Succulent Seafood"?\n
	+ \n
	+ Anyway, maybe it's\n
	+ just me, but being\n
	+ stuck down here...\n
	+ It feels like a reality\n
	+ sitcom. Go figure.
     5 [/1b] = I've been studying this\n
	+ wall for... I think a\n
	+ few weeks now?\n
	+ We've all lost track of\n
	+ time down here, but\n
	+ whatcha gunna do?\n
	+ These inscriptions have\n
	+ been keeping me\n
	+ occupied for sure...\n
	+ But I'm flummoxed by\n
	+ the apparent meaning\n
	+ of some of them.\n
	+ I can't tell if these\n
	+ are truly ancient\n
	+ writings...\n
	+ ...or if they're just\n
	+ mindless scribbles\n
	+ from the refugees.\n
	+ I'll keep rumaging here\n
	+ for now, but results\n
	+ may take a while...
     6 [/1a] = There's a huge monster\n
	+ that lurks around just\n
	+ outside the camp.\n
	+ Its footsteps are so\n
	+ forceful they rattle the\n
	+ entire jungle floor!\n
	+ Most of us stay here\n
	+ in the treetops where\n
	+ it can't reach...\n
	+ In fact, most of the\n
	+ refugees won't even\n
	+ leave their tents.\n
	+ But one guy has been\n
	+ courageously gathering\n
	+ resources for us all.\n
	+ He hasn't come back in\n
	+ a while though, and I\n
	+ can't help but worry...\n
	+ Say, mister... could\n
	+ you go check on 'im?\n
	+ \n
	+ If you find the monster\n
	+ too, anything you can\n
	+ do will be a huge help.
     7	= Oh, hey there!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I hope I didn't scare ya\n
	+ too much. Is anyone\n
	+ worried about me?\n
	+ I've just been foraging\n
	+ for mushrooms to eat.\n
	+ Only some are safe...\n
	+ Huh?\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ No, the glowing ones\n
	+ are NOT safe to eat.\n
	+ Trust me...
     8	= Huh...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I bet if we Piantas\n
	+ could jump higher...\n
	+ \n
	+ We could use those\n
	+ toadstools to get out.\n
	+ You can jump high so-\n
	+ That should be no\n
	+ problem for you, Mr.\n
	+ Jumpman!
     9 [/1c] = I can't remember when\n
	+ I last saw my mom.\n
	+ \n
	+ I hope she's still ok up\n
	+ there in the village.\n
	+ \n
	+ My wife and I fell over\n
	+ the village edge a few\n
	+ months ago I think...\n
	+ But it seems like this\n
	+ guy has been down\n
	+ here waaayyy longer.\n
	+ As long as we don't\n
	+ end up like him, I know\n
	+ I'll see my mom again.
     a [/47] = I don't like that guy.\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ He just stands there\n
	+ dancing all day and\n
	+ shouting at the fire.\n
	+ He doesn't seem\n
	+ hostile towards us...\n
	+ \n
	+ So I suppose we\n
	+ should count our\n
	+ blessings.\n
	+ I wonder what would\n
	+ happen if all the fires\n
	+ went out though...
     b [/1f] = It's convient that the\n
	+ village waterfall above\n
	+ runs right past here.\n
	+ It makes it super easy\n
	+ to bathe and wash my\n
	+ hands right outside.\n
	+ ...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ You don't suppose I'm\n
	+ contaminating our\n
	+ water do you?
     c [/4f] = We're all doing our\n
	+ best to survive until\n
	+ someone rescues us.\n
	+ Most of us have\n
	+ managed pretty OK\n
	+ so far...\n
	+ I suppose it's that\n
	+ natural Pianta instinct\n
	+ from our ancestors.\n
	+ But a few of the\n
	+ refugees have, uh...\n
	+ well...\n
	+ I don't think they'll be\n
	+ going back to Pianta\n
	+ Village anytime soon.
     d [/17] = I'm A ChUckStEr!!!\z{600,1}
     e [/1a] = Ever since we got\n
	+ stranded in this pit...\n
	+ \n
	+ I've made it my pastime\n
	+ to watch over the\n
	+ fish in this pond!\n
	+ However, recently\n
	+ these \z{7ff,200}Cheep-Cheeps\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ have infested it!\n
	+ They are threatening\n
	+ the native fish and\n
	+ trying to eat them!\n
	+ If you can remove\n
	+ the \z{7ff,200}Cheep-Cheeps\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ from the pond...\n
	+ I'll give you a\n
	+ \z{7ff,400}Shine Sprite\z{7ff,0} for\n
	+ your troubles!\n
	+ A hungry \z{7ff,500}dinosaur\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ would definitely eat\n
	+ the \z{7ff,200}Cheep-Cheeps\z{7ff,0}...\n
	+ Good luck!
     f [/22] = You did it! Now the\n
	+ native fish will be\n
	+ safe in their pond.\n
	+ Thanks a bundle!
