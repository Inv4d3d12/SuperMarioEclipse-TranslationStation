     0	= I'm just happy that\n
	+ everyone's safe and\n
	+ sound.
     1	= How terrible! The\n

     9	= This should lead you\n
	+ to the mayor. At\n
	+ least I THINK so...\n
	+ You can move some\n
	+ gates with #.\n
	+ This may help, but...\n
	+ if you try to cling\n
	+ for too long, the\n
	+ gate'll fall off!\n
	+ You'll have to jump to\n
	+ safety at some point,\n
	+ so be careful!

     e	= Thanks to the mayor,\n
	+ everyone was\n
	+ evacuated safely.\n
	+ Now, the only one\n
	+ left is the mayor\n
	+ himself. How brave...\n
     f	= I wonder if everyone\n
	+ knows I'm over here?
    10	= It's too hot! I can't\n
	+ get any closer!
    11	= I hope the mayor's\n
	+ still OK...
    12	= Mom!\n
	+ Where's the mayor?
    13	= The mayor was making\n

	+ strong sense of duty\n
	+ and leadership. Yep...

	+ sure everything's\n
	+ going to be fine!
    16	= Gramps says that he\n
	+ used to babysit the\n
	+ mayor. How wild!\n
	+ He even changed the\n
	+ mayor's diaper...
    17	= \z{600,1}Do something useful!\n
	+ Ouch!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
    18	= The mayor got left\n
	+ behind somewhere\n
	+ over there!
    19	= I just wonder who\n
	+ was behind all of\n
	+ this madness...
    1a	= I hope everything's\n
	+ going to be OK...
