     0	= The port is strangely\n
	+ quiet today, huh?\n
	+ \n
	+ I guess I ought to\n
	+ appreciate the peace\n
	+ and solitude...\n
	+ To be honest, though,\n
	+ I could do with a\n
	+ bit more excitement.
     1	= Hey! This is a\n
	+ dangerous place to be\n
	+ clambering around.\n
	+ And hanging off that\n
	+ hook? An accident\n
	+ in the making!
     2	= \z{600,1}Whoa! You again!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I think I'm ready to\n
	+ chuck you over to the\n
	+ far side. Maybe...\n
	+ Hur-ngaarrh!!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     3	= My big bro keeps on\n
	+ breaking his own\n
	+ long-distance record!\n
	+ He's tossing people\n
	+ around like mad! The\n
	+ distance varies, but...\n
	+ Hey, he likes doing it.
     4	= Urrrgh... My throat\n
	+ hurts so bad. I don't\n
	+ feel like working.
     5	= Our beautiful harbor\n
	+ is clean again! Oh,\n
	+ what a happy day!\n
	+ Still...I have a\n
	+ strange feeling of\n
	+ foreboding...\n
	+ I'm just a worrywart,\n
	+ I guess!
     6	= Now, how would\n
	+ anyone climb all the\n
	+ way up there!?
     7	= You see the Shine\n
	+ Sprite up there?\n
	+ Inside the cage?\n
	+ I found it first!\n
	+ Pretty cool, huh?\n
	+ Wa ha ha ha ha!\n
	+ Now, how in the world\n
	+ can I get up there...?
     8	= Wow, you made it\n
	+ all the way here!\n
	+ Hey, by the way...\n
	+ Have you spoken to\n
	+ that guy on the roof\n
	+ over there?
     9	= Hey, it's just like\n
	+ in the movies!\n
	+ You know the scene?\n
	+ It's where something's\n
	+ on the manhole, and\n
	+ they can't get it open.
     a	= I'm gonna shine this\n
	+ deck 'til the sun\n
	+ smiles back!\n
	+ I'm not quite there,\n
	+ though. Nope, not yet.
     b	= I'm gonna polish 'til\n
	+ I can hear people's\n
	+ shoes squeak on her!\n
	+ Hey! Don't walk there!
