     0	= Welcome back!\n
	+ We're so glad you're\n
	+ safe, Mario!\n
	+ This vacation's just\n
	+ been a whirlwind of\n
	+ bizarre events, huh?\n
	+ And now, the boat\n
	+ to the hotel isn't\n
	+ even running!
     1	= This island seems\n
	+ to be the victim of\n
	+ a bad turn of fate!\n
	+ Oh my, yes...
     2	= I saw it with my\n
	+ own eyes! The man\n
	+ who took the\n
	+ princess was using\n
	+ a brush to draw\n
	+ graffiti! I saw it!
     3	= I heard this was a\n
	+ sun-splashed isle,\n
	+ but it sure is dark!\n
	+ Is it because they've\n
	+ lost their so-called\n
	+ "Shine Sprites"?
     4	= Everyone on this\n
	+ isle loves to do\n
	+ the "box-breaker"!\n
	+ Just jump up and\n
	+ press < above\n
	+ a box!\n
	+ Ka-SMASH!\n
	+ Why don't you give\n
	+ it a try?
     5	= Mario! Are you used\n
	+ to using that FLUDD\n
	+ thing now?\n
	+ You can also switch\n
	+ it to a hover device\n
	+ with +!
     6	= A long time ago,\n
	+ Yoshis lived on this\n
	+ island as well.
     7	= Hey! Are you\n
	+ slacking off!?
     8	= And clean up those\n
	+ walls, slacker!
     9	= This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     a	= It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     b	= It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     c	= I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     d	= Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     e	= Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     f	= When are we going\n
	+ to have another\n
	+ scandalous incident?\n
	+ I'm so bored.\n
	+ Nothing fun ever\n
	+ happens here.
    10	= It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this daytime?\n
	+ \n
	+ I guess cities are\n
	+ just dark all the\n
	+ time, huh?
    11	= Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    12	= Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    13	= So, it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n
	+ I just wish the sun\n
	+ would return and\n
	+ tan us like before!
    14	= So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    15	= That's hogwash!\n
	+ Your ancestors were\n
	+ all hairdressers!\n
	+ You liar!
    16	= I'm not lying!\n
	+ I even saw the\n
	+ plans for it!\n
	+ You're just not\n
	+ listening to me, you\n
	+ pickled squid-brain!
    17	= Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    18	= These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...
    19	= I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
    1a	= Oh, I'm getting that\n
	+ feeling again.\n
	+ This is not good.\n
	+ Has something bad\n
	+ happened again?\n
	+ It feels like it!\n
	+ Mario, please check\n
	+ it out for me...
    1b	= Master Mario! Have\n
	+ you seen the\n
	+ message updates?\n
	+ They're from the\n
	+ Delfino Emergency\n
	+ Broadcast System.\n
	+ They'll tell you\n
	+ what's happening\n
	+ on the island!
    1c	= I saw it with my\n
	+ own eyes! The man\n
	+ who took the\n
	+ princess was using\n
	+ a brush to draw\n
	+ graffiti! I saw it!
    1d	= The Shine Gate's to\n
	+ the north, and the\n
	+ lighthouse is east.\n
	+ The boathouse is\n
	+ to the west, and\n
	+ we're down south.\n
	+ You can press $\n
	+ to view the\n
	+ guidebook map!
    1e	= Everyone on this\n
	+ isle loves to do\n
	+ the "box-breaker"!\n
	+ Just jump up and\n
	+ press < above\n
	+ a box!\n
	+ Ka-SMASH!\n
	+ Why don't you give\n
	+ it a try?
    1f	= Mario! Are you used\n
	+ to using that FLUDD\n

	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
    29	= What's that?\n
	+ Hold on!\n
	+ I smell it!\n
	+ Something's going to\n
	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
    2a	= It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are cities all dark?
    2b	= Now where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    2c	= Unforgivable! I have\n

	+ haven't we met?
    2d	= So it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n

	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    2f	= So the model for\n
	+ the Grand Pianta\n
	+ was your ancestor?\n
	+ That's ridiculous!\n
	+ Seriously, come on!\n
	+ You are such a liar!\n
	+ It's because of liars\n
	+ like you that our\n
	+ Shine Sprites left us!
    30	= I'm NOT lying! \n
	+ I saw the plans for\n
	+ the statue!\n
	+ Why don't you use\n
	+ your ears and start\n
	+ listening to me!\n
	+ It's because of\n
	+ squid-brains like you\n
	+ that it got dark!
    31	= Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    32	= These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
