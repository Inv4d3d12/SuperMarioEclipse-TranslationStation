     0	= Excellent! Way to go,\n
	+ Master Mario!\n
	+ \n
	+ You have returned our\n
	+ waterfall to normal!\n
	+ Bravo! \n
	+ What's that?\n
	+ The ocean's still\n
	+ dirty? Strange...\n
	+ It looks like my\n
	+ theory was way off!\n
	+ Hyo ho ho HACKPTH!\n
	+ That's OK. I think\n
	+ I've got a lead on\n
	+ the real cause...\n
	+ Now, this may not\n
	+ seem like much of\n
	+ a reward, but...\n
	+ I'm going to reveal to\n
	+ you one of Noki Bay's\n
	+ deepest secrets!
     1	= This bay actually\n
	+ contains the tomb of\n
	+ an ancient Noki king!\n
	+ When you spray water\n
	+ on the wall paintings,\n
	+ a path usually opens.\n
	+ It's almost like magic!\n
	+ And one path leads to\n
	+ a hidden Shine Sprite!\n
	+ Honest! This is all\n
	+ true! Maybe...
     2	= Spray them with\n
	+ water! Hyo ho ho ho!
     3	= Mario, thanks for all\n
	+ your help earlier! That\n
	+ was truly spectacular!\n
	+ Would you mind being\n
	+ my new teacher?\n
	+ I mean... Never mind!\n
	+ My grandpa's up\n
	+ ahead, and he wants\n
	+ to tell you something.
     4	= Now that our waterfall\n
	+ is back to normal, I\n
	+ can resume business!\n
	+ Thanks, Master Mario!\n
	+ In return, please use\n
	+ my boats at any time!\n
	+ ...Free of charge, of\n
	+ course! I don't have\n
	+ any oars, though...\n
	+ Looks like you'll have\n
	+ to use your pump to\n
	+ get around, hm?
     5	= M U D B O A T \n
	+ R E N T A L\n
	+ -90,000 COINS-\n
	+ Mudboats Are Fun!\n
	+ Come Aboard!\n
