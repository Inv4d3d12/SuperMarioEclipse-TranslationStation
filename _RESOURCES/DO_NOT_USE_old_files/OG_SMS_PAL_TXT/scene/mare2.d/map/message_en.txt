     0	= \z{600,1}I've got it! Yes!\n
	+ I surely do have it!\n
	+ What have I got?\n
	+ Why, the answer to\n
	+ our polluted ocean\n
	+ problem, of course!\n
	+ And the answer is\n
	+ you! You must go to\n
	+ the ocean floor!\n
	+ Of course, that is\n
	+ impossible for you\n
	+ at the moment...\n
	+ Therefore, I've made\n
	+ an area for you to\n
	+ hone your skills!\n

	+ But don't overdo it!\n
	+ If you run low on air,\n
	+ here's what you do...\n
	+ Just grab some\n
	+ regular coins to refill\n
	+ your meter, OK?\n
	+ Now, shall we get\n
	+ started?\z{700,5000} \z{700,0}
