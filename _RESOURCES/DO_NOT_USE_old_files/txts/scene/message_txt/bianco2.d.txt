     1	= Something's wrong...\n
	+ My women's intuition\n
	+ must be warning me...
     2	= Are you the\n

     4	= I heard awful noises\n
	+ in the \z{7ff,400}Hillside Cave\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ on the far shore...\n

	+ You can see it from\n
	+ the path that leads to\n
	+ the \z{7ff,400}Big \z{7ff,400}Windmill\z{7ff,0}.\n
	+ As you go up the hill,\n
	+ look right before you\n

	+ Anyway, I was hanging\n
	+ out near the entrance\n
	+ the other day...\n
	+ Suddenly, this weird-\n

	+ me! I took off quick!\n
	+ I saw him bust the\n
	+ cave gate open and\n
	+ vanish inside. Yikes!

	+ ran under the bridge.\n
	+ I wonder if something\n
	+ bad was after him...\n
	+ How disturbing.\z{7ff,400}\z{7ff,0}
