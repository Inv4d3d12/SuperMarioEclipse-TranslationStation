	+ You're with the island\n
	+ rescue, right? Yeah.\n
	+ Listen, I, uh, have a\n
	+ feeling you can\n
	+ help me out again...\n
	+ See, the hotel, it's...\n
	+ Well, it's full of...\n
	+ It's full of ghosts!\n
	+ So, well, could you\n
	+ maybe... Look, just\n
	+ come inside, please.\n
	+ I can tell you're a\n
	+ miracle worker.\n
	+ Don't be so modest.\n

	+ Can I get checked in\n
	+ here, or what?
     2	= I'm utterly exhausted.\n
	+ Please let me rest.
     3	= We can't go in yet,\n

	+ \n
	+ Yeah, that's pretty\n

	+ something anyway...
     4	= I'm beginning to\n
	+ have my doubts\n
	+ about this guy...
     5	= Wha...what?\n
	+ We STILL can't go in?\n
	+ What's going on?
     6	= Listen to me! We're\n
	+ not going to stand\n
	+ for this! No no NO!
     7	= My apologies, but the\n
	+ hotel is currently\n
	+ still being prepared.\n
	+ We'll let you in as\n
	+ soon as we're able.\n
	+ Please be patient.
     8	= Look, I'm sorry.\n
	+ So very sorry.\n
	+ Really, awfully sorry.\n
	+ I just work here.\n
	+ I don't know anything.\n
	+ So, please don't yell.
     9	= To tell the truth, I\n
	+ was worried about\n
	+ what might happen...
