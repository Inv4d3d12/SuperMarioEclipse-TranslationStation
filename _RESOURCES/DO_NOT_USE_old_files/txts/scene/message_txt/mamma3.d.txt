     0	= That big caterpillar is\n
	+ finally gone. Whew!\n
	+ \n
	+ Now, I can get back to\n
	+ tending my Dune Buds\n
	+ in peace!
     1	= You know, I was a\n
	+ pretty wild child\n
	+ back in my day.\n
	+ Even so, I find myself\n
	+ yelling at the kids to\n
	+ QUIET DOWN!!!
     2	= Sliding down the patch\n
	+ of odd-colored sand\n
	+ there is tons of fun.\n
	+ But I think sitting\n
	+ here and enjoying the\n
	+ view is nice, too.
     3	= I wonder if you can\n
	+ see it from here...?\n
	+ \n
	+ There's a coral reef\n
	+ out there that is\n

	+ The Sand Bird... It\n
	+ finally hatched!\n
	+ Don't bother looking\n
	+ for it, though. It flew\n
	+ off right away.
     6	= This kid keeps talking\n
	+ about jumping into\n
	+ that hole down there.\n
	+ It isn't just unsafe;\n
	+ it's impossible!\n
	+ Huh? YOU can do it?
     7	= I wanna slide down\n
	+ and dive onto that\n
	+ platform down there. \n
	+ I think I might be able\n
	+ to bounce from there\n
	+ right into that hole!
     8	= \z{600,1}The store is closed\n
	+ today for family\n
	+ play time.\n
	+ When my son slides\n
	+ down, I'm going to\n
	+ throw him back up.\n
	+ ...But he doesn't\n
	+ seem to be coming\n
	+ down at all...\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     9	= \z{600,1}I wanna try that\n
	+ throwing thing\n
	+ sometime, too!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     a	= It... It... It hatched!\n
	+ The legendary Sand\n
	+ Bird is born!\n
	+ It broke the tower\n
	+ and flew away! That\n
