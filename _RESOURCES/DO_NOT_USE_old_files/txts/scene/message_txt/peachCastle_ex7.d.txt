     0	= I just moved here from\n
	+ the plaza down the\n
	+ mountain.\n
	+ I was hoping to\n
	+ settle in to relaxing\n
	+ country life...\n
	+ But those creepy\n
	+ bouncing heads just\n
	+ appeared today!\n
	+ Is this just how things\n
	+ are gonna be around\n
	+ here? I sure hope not.
     1	= What- are- those-\n
	+ \z{7ff,200}things???\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ \n
	+ Hideous old goblins if\n
	+ I ever saw one...\n
	+ \n
	+ The way they just hop\n
	+ around, smiling at\n
	+ everyone... uuuggh...\n
	+ I think I'll just\n
	+ stay over here until\n
	+ they leave.
     2	= The village founders\n
	+ say those heads look\n
	+ like one they once saw.\n
	+ Except it was on a\n
	+ much bigger creature\n
	+ that spit goop!\n
	+ I'd hate to see such a\n
	+ thing, wouldn't you?\n
	+ \n
	+ You don't suppose it\n
	+ might... come back?
     3	= I've been working on\n
	+ my recipes for grape\n
	+ products lately.\n
	+ You can see they grow\n
	+ plentifully around the\n
	+ lake area.\n
	+ Unfortunately, grapes\n
	+ are beginning to go\n
	+ out of style.\n
	+ Most people just\n
	+ want bananas or\n
	+ papayas now...\n
	+ If my business doesn't\n
	+ pick up, I may have to\n
	+ pack up shop.\n
	+ Which means all the\n
	+ grapevines by the lake\n
	+ will be no more...
     4	= Hey you!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ What was that spinning\n
	+ thing you just did?\n
	+ \n
	+ On the rope- spinning\n
	+ around by spraying\n
	+ water and jumping off?\n
	+ That's pretty neat. You\n
	+ come up with a name\n
	+ for it yet?\n
	+ Can you teach me how\n
	+ to do that? Ha ha!
     5	= Ha! My neighbor thinks\n
	+ her kids are just so\n
	+ great and all that.\n
	+ After we rebuilt the\n
	+ village, now they just\n
	+ run twice as far away!\n
	+ I think I'm ready to\n
	+ have some kids of\n
	+ my own.\n
	+ I'll show how great of\n
	+ a mother I can be!\n
	+ \n
	+ Just you wait!!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     6	= We just got these\n
	+ fancy new vanes put\n
	+ up on our huts.\n
	+ Now eclectricity will\n
	+ be generated straight\n
	+ into our homes! Waha!
     7	= What's the deal with\n
	+ these Piranhabons?\n
	+ \n
	+ I heard they infested\n
	+ this village several\n
	+ years ago...\n
	+ But now they started\n
	+ jumping out of that\n
	+ cave over there!\n
	+ I betcha if we could\n
	+ get them to stop...\n
	+ \n
	+ ...that Hillside Cave\n
	+ would make a pretty\n
	+ cool hang-out spot.
     8	= I think I wanna\n
	+ remodel my hut.\n
	+ \n
	+ Do you think chestnut\n
	+ wood accents might\n
	+ look nice?
     9	= \z{600,1}Rggh... I can't even\n
	+ take my morning walk\n
	+ with all this going on!\n
	+ These Piranhabons are\n
	+ just trouncing on\n
	+ everything in their way!\n
	+ Including me!!!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     a	= See the \z{7ff,400}Big Windmill\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ over there?\n
	+ \n
	+ Originally it used to\n
	+ be much closer to the\n
	+ village nearby.\n
	+ But after a landslide\n
	+ created the lake...\n
	+ \n
	+ ...it was relocated to\n
	+ sturdy ground over\n
	+ on that hill.\n
	+ You shoulda seen the\n
	+ old village- it was\n
	+ really cute, heh!\n
	+ In fact, this whole\n
	+ valley really grew over\n
	+ the past few years.
     b	= They're getting ready\n
	+ to tear these old\n
	+ birdhouses down soon.\n
	+ They want to build\n
	+ sturdier wooden\n
	+ windmills I think.\n
	+ I'll miss these old\n
	+ things, sure, but...\n
	+ \n
	+ I suppose it's pointless\n
	+ to stand in the way of\n
	+ progress.\n
	+ Maybe I'll head over\n
	+ to Pianta Village to do\n
	+ some birdwatching!\n
	+ I've heard some nice\n
	+ birds like to hang\n
	+ around above the pit...
     c	= I'm sorry, mister!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Really, I am.\n
	+ Please don't tell\n
	+ my mother, OK?
     d	= You think it's weird\n
	+ how Piranhabons come\n
	+ out of the other cave...\n
	+ ...but not this one?\n
	+ Why is that, huh?\n
	+ \n
	+ Well, it's better\n
	+ for me!\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm gonna go scope\n
	+ that cave out. Wonder\n
	+ what's inside?
     e	= \n
	+ {                 }\n
	+ \n
	+  Ricco          Pinna\n
	+ Harbor          Park\n
