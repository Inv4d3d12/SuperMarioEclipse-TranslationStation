     0	= Oh, welcome Master\n
	+ Mario! Come for\n
	+ training I presume?\n
	+ Ah yes, these doors\n
	+ hold the path to true\n
	+ enlightenment!\n
	+ At the end of each\n
	+ path lies a piece to\n
	+ open the temple gate.\n
	+ By overcoming these\n
	+ challenges, you will\n
	+ refine your skills...\n
	+ and help us escape\n
	+ the temple so I can\n
	+ get back to fishing.\n
	+ Good luck!
     1	= What are you waiting\n
	+ for Master Mario?\n
	+ \n
	+ Go be a hero and\n
	+ finish the challenges\n
	+ so I can go fishing!
     2	= Ah yes, it seems\n
	+ you have finished\n
	+ your training\z{700,2800}...\z{700,700}finally.\z{700,0}\n
	+ Feel free to return\n
	+ if you desire to\n
	+ sharpen your skills.\n
	+ You can do so by\n
	+ breaking the \z{7ff,300}"?"\z{7ff,0} block\n
	+ above...where again?\n
	+ It seems I have \n
	+ forgotten!\n
	+ \n
	+ Also, do remember\n
	+ to visit the game's\n
	+ \z{7ff,500}settings menu\z{7ff,0}, yes?\n
	+ You should find many\n
	+ useful things there,\n
	+ that I'm certain of!
     3	= Why do you hesitate?\n
	+ Enjoy the journey\n
	+ ahead of you!\z{600,0}....\z{700,0}\n
	+ I don't suppose you\n
	+ would like to go\n
	+ fishing would you?
     4	= Ah, it seems you\n
	+ need to make your\n
	+ way up these clouds.\n
	+ I wish I could go\n
	+ with you, there seems\n
	+ to be no fish here...
     5	= Not too long ago\n
	+ this old man was\n
	+ very wealthy, yes!\n
	+ I was never very good\n
	+ at roulette though...
     6	= Ah, it seems your\n
	+ mechanical companion\n
	+ has gotten lost!\n
	+ Not to worry cricket!\n
	+ You seem to be \n
	+ rather agile...\n
	+ Try long jumping\n
	+ across the gaps\n
	+ with \z{7ff,300}$\z{7ff,0} and \z{7ff,500}@\z{7ff,0}!
     7	= For 7.99 you can\n
	+ hit the griddy!\n
