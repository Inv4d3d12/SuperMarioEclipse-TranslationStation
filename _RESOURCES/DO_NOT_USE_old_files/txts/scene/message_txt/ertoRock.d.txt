     0	= Why, hello good sir!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Unfortunately the train\n
	+ isn't ready to leave\n
	+ the station just yet.\n
	+ But the Delfino Express\n
	+ will be on its way\n
	+ soon enough! Yes, yes!
     1	= These bananas are\n
	+ tasty, sure...\n
	+ \n
	+ But what I'd really like\n
	+ right about now are\n
	+ some flamin' peppers!\n
	+ I know it's already so\n
	+ hot up here as it is...\n
	+ \n
	+ Listen, could you just\n
	+ help me out?\n
	+ \n
	+ Find a pepper and\n
	+ bring it back here\n
	+ to me.\n
	+ I promise I'll make it\n
	+ VERY worth your while.
     2	= These darned kids with\n
	+ their water spouts are\n
	+ making the dirt muddy.\n
	+ I was just trying to\n
	+ cross the road and I\n
	+ tripped in a huge mess!
     3	= I kid you not-\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ The raw heat from the\n
	+ sun up here just set my\n
	+ mushrooms on fire.\n
	+ I'm going home.
     4	= ...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ There's nothing here,\n
	+ I swear.
     5	= The flea market is\n
	+ always a great place\n
	+ to find sweet deals.\n
	+ I come here every\n
	+ month and always go\n
	+ home with something.\n
	+ I'm sure you can find\n
	+ plenty of neat things\n
	+ if you scout around.
     6	= Whew...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I've been stuck up\n
	+ here for an hour now.\n
	+ \n
	+ I got scared after\n
	+ taking the first zipline\n
	+ down...\n
	+ And now I'm too\n
	+ chicken to go the rest\n
	+ of the way!\n
	+ I better get over my\n
	+ fear soon, because I\n
	+ have no water up here.
     7	= My mom is always on\n
	+ the hunt for a great\n
	+ bargain.\n
	+ When we come here to\n
	+ trade, I get to play in\n
	+ the water sprinklers.\n
	+ And whenever we go\n
	+ home, we take the big\n
	+ train, choo-choo!\n
	+ I'm happy my mom gets\n
	+ neat things, but really\n
	+ I just enjoy the trip.
     8	= This cliffside is such a\n
	+ dry place. The water\n
	+ sprinklers are perfect!\n
	+ I can run around with\n
	+ the other kids without\n
	+ getting too hot.\n
	+ Remember to stay\n
	+ cool and hydrated,\n
	+ funny mister!
     9	= If you're looking for\n
	+ anyone in town, you\n
	+ won't have much luck.\n
	+ Everyone around this\n
	+ time is usually down\n
	+ in the market.\n
	+ Me? Eh, I've never\n
	+ been the hard\n
	+ bargain type.\n
	+ I may grab a snack or\n
	+ two, but I'm content\n
	+ to take a quiet walk.\n
	+ The mornings up here\n
	+ really do help me feel\n
	+ quite youthful!
     a	= What? I thought a\n
	+ blue coin was a\n
	+ great reward!\n
	+ Shine Sprites don't\n
	+ just grow on trees\n
	+ you know...
