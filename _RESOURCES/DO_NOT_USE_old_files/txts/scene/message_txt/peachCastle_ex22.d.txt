     0	= Oh my, a new visitor!\n
	+ Welcome to Isle\n
	+ Meduse,\n
	+ Home of the largest\n
	+ port on this exact\n
	+ latitude!\n
	+ I'm the mayor of this\n
	+ humble little town, so\n
	+ nice to meet you!\n
	+ We're so happy to have\n
	+ visitors to our home.\n
	+ It's been long time.\n
	+ A very, very long time...\n
	+ Oh, you must excuse me.\n
	+ Please, explore!
     1	= Fifteen years I've been\n
	+ working here. It's hard work,\n
	+ but it really pays off after\n
	+ a job well done. What do I\n
	+ do, you ask? Why, isn't it\n
	+ obvious? How do you think\n
	+ the beach is so smooth? I\n
	+ brush it, of course! From\n
	+ sunrise to sunset, theres no\n
	+ rest for a humble beach sweeper.\n
	+ Except during my break.\n
	+ Like right now.
     2	= Ya know, sometimes\n
	+ I wonder what it would\n
	+ be like on those other\n
	+ islands out there. Eh,\n
	+ I bet it would be boring.\n
	+ What could they even\n
	+ have? Not like there's\n
	+ any sort of grand adventure\n
	+ out there.
     3	= Have you heard this idiot?\n
	+ He's spouting nonsense, I'll\n
	+ tell ya! The nerve of this guy!
     4	= Listen, all I'm saying is that\n
	+ I've never seen batman\n
	+ and bruce wayne in the same room
     5	= What a fine bench!
     6	= Folks round here keep\n
	+ makin fun of me for\n
	+ puttin fish in this pond.\n
	+ They won't be laughin\n
	+ when my army of fish\n
	+ fall in at my side!\n
	+ ...I might need a new\n
	+ hobby.
     7	= I really need to get\n
	+ past these ladies to\n
	+ go home...\n
	+ I don't want to be a\n
	+ bother. Suppose it's\n
	+ only been two hours...
     8	= We've been waiting for\n
	+ that cute man to talk\n
	+ to us for so long.\n
	+ Is he not intrested?\n
	+ Should we move?\n
	+ Men are so confusing.
     9	= I don't know why, but I've\n
	+ never been more relaxed than\n
	+ whenever I stand at this exact spot.\n
	+ The warm bricks, the gentle fountain,\n
	+ the bright plants. Its.. perfect.
     a	= Where have my sweet\n
	+ little boy gone? I haven't\n
	+ seen him all day\n
	+ He's old enough to be\n
	+ on his own, but I just\n
	+ get so worried.\n
	+ Excuse me sir, could\n
	+ you find him and bring\n
	+ him back to me?\n
	+ I know it sounds a little\n
	+ strange but you would\n
	+ be rewarded.
     b	= You're saying my mom\n
	+ wants me back home?\n
	+ Well I'm not going!\n
	+ I'm having too much fun\n
	+ here. What cha' gonna\n
	+ to do, carry me home? \z{901,59657300}\u{14e6f}
     c	= Mom wants me home? Ha!\n
	+ Like I'd go anywhere\n
	+ with you, scrublord.\n
	+ What ya gonna do about\n
	+ that? Think a flabby man\n
	+ like you could carry me? \z{901,59657300}\u{14e6f}
     d	= Wait what
     e	= Ha, I knew it!
     f	= This is not my child!\n
	+ What's wrong with you?!\n
	+ Kidnapping a child!?!\n
	+ You should be\n
	+ ashamed of yourself!
    10	= Thank you so much!\n
	+ Please, take this! It's\n
	+ the least I could do.
    11	= It's you! I can't belive\n
	+ it's really...Oh.\n
	+ You're not Wario.\n
	+ Begone, I'm not\n
	+ interested in talking to\n
	+ Wario knockoffs.
    12	= Where art thou, my\n
	+ yellow prince? I wish\n
	+ to shower you in love!\n
	+ I would never have a\n
	+ rotten day, as long as\n
	+ you were around.
    13	= You're still here?\n
	+ Begone.\n
	+ \n
	+ You sully the mere\n
	+ thought of my knight\n
	+ in golden armor.
    14	= Duude, hows it hangin?\n
	+ Welcome to my humble\n
	+ little surf hut.\n
	+ We have the best\n
	+ boards round for shreadin\n
	+ the gnar!\n
	+ Totally worth the coinage,\n
	+ my dude.You should try\n
	+ it out at some point!
    15	= Hey girl, you hear\n
	+ about pluto? Thats\n
	+ messed up, right?
    16	= This guy has been standing here\n
	+ repeating that line every time I\n
	+ look his direction. I keep\n
	+ pretending like I don't actually\n
	+ notice him so he looks away\n
	+ quickly and acts like he didnt\n
	+ say anything until I glance\n
	+ his way again.\n
	+ This might be the worst\n
	+ day of my life.
    17	= Don't worry about me, I'm fine.\n
	+ I heard from a long distance\n
	+ friend that running like youre\n
	+ on fire helps the hamstrings\n
	+ loosen up! I sure do feel the\n
	+ burn though, huhuhu!
