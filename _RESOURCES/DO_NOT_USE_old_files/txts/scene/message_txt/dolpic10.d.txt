     0	= I say! Have you seen\n
	+ that cruise liner just\n
	+ offshore?\n
	+ If you're looking for\n
	+ the princess, she\n
	+ already went ahead.\n
	+ Perhaps we should\n
	+ all trek over and\n
	+ take a ride?
     1	= Wow! Did you see\n
	+ the big ship?
     2	= I'm so glad Peach\n
	+ is safe again!
     3	= Who could've guessed\n
	+ it was Bowser all\n
	+ along?
     4	= You sure are getting\n
	+ good at navigating\n
	+ the island!
     5	= I wonder what other\n
	+ secrets there are to\n
	+ find?
     6	= Whoa! That water\n
	+ receded in a flash!
     7	= You say that flood\n
	+ cleaned up the \n
	+ whole town? Really?\n
	+ Are you absolutely\n
	+ sure about that?
     8	= Wow! This place is\n
	+ all tidy! Everything's\n
	+ so bright and clean!
     9	= The flood waters\n
	+ went away so fast!\n
	+ Are the fish OK?
     a	= It sure has gotten\n
	+ a lot brighter\n
	+ around here...
     b	= Durians are on the\n
	+ right, and coconuts\n
	+ are on the left.
     c	= This weather just\n
	+ feels great!
     d	= It sure feels like\n
	+ the light of the sun\n
	+ is back with us!
     e	= Could this be the\n
	+ end of the game?\n
	+ \n
	+ I hope something\n
	+ else happens!
     f	= I guess cities are\n
	+ just dangerous...\n
	+ I prefer the country!
    10	= Well, I guess I'll\n
	+ be heading back to\n
	+ Pianta Village soon.\n
	+ It really is the only\n
	+ place for me!
    11	= Well, you don't see\n
	+ much graffiti around\n
	+ here anymore...\n
	+ I guess I can take\n
	+ this down now...
    12	= Wow! This place is\n
	+ almost as bright as\n
	+ it used to be!\n
	+ I'm ready for that\n
	+ sun to burn me to\n
	+ a crisp again.
    13	= I must say, you're\n
	+ looking much better\n
	+ these days, too!
    14	= You should come\n
	+ visit me in the\n
	+ country sometime!
    15	= I'm taking as many\n
	+ mushrooms with me\n
	+ as I can!
    16	= Boy, boats sure are\n
	+ convenient, huh?
    17	= You want to go out\n
	+ to that island?\n
	+ Are you sure?\n
	+ All right, then!\n
	+ Hop in there, and\n
	+ cover your ears!
    18	= Shall I take you\z{901,59657300}\u{14e6f}\n
	+ out to the Airstrip?\n
	+ It's completely free!
    19	= To the sea!\n
	+ It's time to push\n
	+ off and head out!\n
	+ Don't expect any\n
	+ sea shanties from\n
	+ this captain, mate!
    1a	= Well, maybe next time!\n
	+ Remember, my price is\n
	+ always a smile!
    1b	= I just want to...\n
	+ get back...to that...\n
	+ island...
    1c	= Shall I take you\z{901,59657300}\u{14e6f}\n
	+ out to the Cruiser?\n
	+ It's completely free!
    1d	= So then...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Fire Shrine is gone.\n
	+ I can no longer keep\n
	+ watch for new Shines.\n
	+ I appreciate all the\n
	+ effort you've put into\n
	+ recovering the rest...\n
	+ ...but I'm not sure it\n
	+ will even matter in\n
	+ the end.\n
	+ With the temple\n
	+ destroyed, newborn\n
	+ Shines may disappear.\n
	+ It's too early to tell.
