     0	= Yarrr... Ever think\n
	+ o' video games\n
	+ as pirate's booty?
     1	= AHA!! I've found it!\n
	+ There's real treasure\n
	+ here!\n
	+ Now I just have to\n
	+ dig it up...
     2	= Are you having a\n
	+ good time?
     3	= Uh-oh. My boss is\n
	+ probably gonna\n
	+ come looking for me.\n
	+ I gotta finish lunch\n
	+ before he finds me!
     4	= I think I'll just\n
	+ wait here.
     5	= I wonder if those\n
	+ ships can still sail...\n
	+ \n
	+ The sails look intact.\n
	+ I wonder why they\n
	+ don't drift away?
     6	= Ah, good sir! Perhaps\n
	+ you can help me...\n
	+ \n
	+ We've finally gotten\n
	+ the lagoon cleared\n
	+ out, you see.\n
	+ Which means we can\n
	+ resume our submarine\n
	+ rescue mission!\n
	+ It drifted somewhere\n
	+ out beyond the shore.\n
	+ \n
	+ If you find it, can you\n
	+ hop inside and tell me\n
	+ if it's still working?
     7	= I really appreciate\n
	+ you helping us out.\n
	+ \n
	+ ...Huh? Draft?\n
	+ What draft?
     8	= I'm not going home\n
	+ anytime soon\n
	+ aren't I?
     9	= Do you suppose I\n
	+ could be helping\n
	+ out more?
     a	= Torpedo Ted? Now\n
	+ you're just putting\n
	+ words together, haha.
     b	= I think I'm beginning\n
	+ to lose track of it all.
     c	= ...Whew, my days off\n
	+ around here are\n
	+ kinda boring...
     d	= Maybe I should just\n
	+ leave the bloopers\n
	+ alone?
     e	= 14
     f	= Hey, someone finally\n
	+ found me!\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm looking at this\n
	+ old treasure map\n
	+ that was lost in here.\n
	+ I think there's a\n
	+ lost treasure picture\n
	+ out there somewhere!\n
	+ All I can gather is\n
	+ that it was hidden\n
	+ in the sand...\n
	+ If you go searching,\n
	+ I wish you luck!

	+ During testing of our\n
	+ new submarine, we uh,\n
	+ hit the wrong button...\n
	+ And now the entire\n
	+ lagoon is crawling\n
	+ with deadly mines!\n
	+ Use the rockets we've\n
	+ very strategically put\n
	+ on the vintage ships.\n
	+ No, it's not violating\n
	+ history! Get back in\n
	+ line soldier!!\n
	+ Huh? You don't\n
	+ want to?\n
