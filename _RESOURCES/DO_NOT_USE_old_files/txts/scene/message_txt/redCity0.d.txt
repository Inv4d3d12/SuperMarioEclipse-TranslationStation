     0	= 0
     1	= Well I wanted to play\n
	+ with my friends today,\n
	+ but look at this!\n
	+ Nobody wants to come\n
	+ get tossed around by\n
	+ all the cataquacks.\n
	+ I guess I'll just stay\n
	+ here.
     2	= I just can't make up\n
	+ my mind... Tulips\n
	+ or roses?
     3	= What do you\n
	+ mean "closed for\n
	+ maintenance"??\n
	+ They said the latest\n
	+ book in the series\n
	+ would be here today!\n
	+ I demand my copy!!
     4	= I love working at this\n
	+ cafe! Everyone is so\n
	+ friendly and lively!\n
	+ Now if only I could\n
	+ actually see over\n
	+ the countertop...
     5	= Getting lost yet?\n
	+ Heh-heh!\n
	+ \n
	+ This place isn't so\n
	+ big once you get the\n
	+ hang of it.
     6	= Do you ever worry\n
	+ about falling from\n
	+ somewhere really high?\n
	+ I used to back on the\n
	+ main island.\n
	+ \n
	+ But after moving here,\n
	+ I got used to things.\n
	+ \n
	+ Still, it's ok to be\n
	+ afraid sometimes.\n
	+ \n
	+ Just think about why\n
	+ you do what you do.\n
	+ \n
	+ You'll find your\n
	+ courage again!
     7	= Welcome to Red Lily\n
	+ City! Watch your step-\n
	+ It's a long way down...
     8	= You know what's the\n
	+ only thing that beats\n
	+ a shopping spree?\n
	+ The great lunch you\n
	+ get to have after!\n
	+ Haha!
     9	= Have you uncovered\n
	+ all of the city's\n
	+ secrets yet?\n
	+ Everything might not\n
	+ be open right now,\n
	+ actually.\n
	+ You should probaly\n
	+ take care of the\n
	+ important stuff first.
     a	= There's a large\n
	+ generator room under\n
	+ here.\n
	+ It keeps the power\n
	+ on across the city.\n
	+ \n
	+ But occasionally it\n
	+ runs slow, and we\n
	+ have to reboot it.\n
	+ Did you find\n
	+ something in the city\n
	+ that wasn't working?\n
	+ Maybe head down\n
	+ there and give that\n
	+ button a good whack!
     b	= Been having fun\n
	+ jumping all around\n
	+ the rooftops?\n
	+ If you need a quick\n
	+ boost, maybe the\n
	+ cataquacks can help.

	+ You must truly be a\n
	+ movement master!\n
	+ Could I be the jabby\n
	+ banana after all? No!\n
	+ I must train harder.\n
	+ You've earned this.\n
	+ One day I shall\n
	+ reclaim my pride!
