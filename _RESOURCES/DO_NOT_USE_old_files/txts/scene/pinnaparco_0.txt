     0	= Oh ho! A guest!\n
	+ How fabulous!\n
	+ Welcome indeed!\n
	+ I am the director of\n
	+ Pinna Park! It's\n
	+ truly my pleasure!\n
	+ Because of these\n
	+ blasted Koopas, we\n
	+ get few visitors...\n
	+ Sadly, our park has\n
	+ become more than a\n
	+ bit run-down.\n
	+ We don't have a\n
	+ single star attraction\n
	+ to speak of!
     1	= This is the\n
	+ Yoshi-Go-Round!\n
	+ Know about Yoshis?\n
	+ They used to roam\n
	+ this island freely, but\n
	+ now, they've gone...
     2	= Look at that! Only the\n
	+ orange Yoshi on the\n
	+ ride disappeared!\n
	+ What does it mean,\n
	+ mister? Huh? Huh?
     3	= Yoshis can turn\n
	+ anything into\n
	+ platforms!\n
	+ Isn't that cool?
     4	= Yoshis are born from\n
	+ eggs. Yes! Eggs just\n
	+ like these!
     5	= I'm terribly sorry, but\n
	+ this ride is currently\n
	+ under maintenance...
     6	= Hunh? Did something\n
	+ run by just now?
     7	= Whuzzah?! Who was\n
	+ that guy just now?
     8	= Sorry, we're just\n
	+ about to start working\n
	+ on this ride...
     9	= We're currently doing\n
	+ test runs on this ride.\n
	+ Sorry, but come again!
     a	= Whee! Ha! There's a\n
	+ Roller Coaster and a\n
	+ Pirate Ship and WOW!
     b	= Please be careful of\n
	+ the Electro-Koopas\n
	+ around the park...
     c	= This ride is currently\n
	+ under maintenance.\n
	+ Please come again!
     d	= La la la! Lalalalala!\n
	+ I'm Ducky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Hee hee!\n
	+ Clam Cups are the\n
	+ funnest ever!
     e	= La dee la! Dah dah!\n
	+ I'm Plucky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Ha ha!\n
	+ This clam is closed!\n
	+ Is that weird?
     f	= Wah dee dah! Wah!\n
	+ I'm Lucky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Wah ha!\n
