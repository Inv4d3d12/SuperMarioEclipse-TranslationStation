     0 [/27] = Now, this here is what\n
	+ we call a \z{7ff,400}Dune Bud.\z{7ff,400}\n
	+ \n
	+ Dune Buds are odd\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ plants that appear\n
	+ only on this beach.\n
	+ If you water them,\n
	+ strange things\n
	+ will happen.
     1 [/30] = Isle Delfino is often\n
	+ referred to as a slice\n
	+ of paradise on earth.\n
	+ And Gelato Beach?\n
	+ Why, it's its most\n
	+ sun-kissed shore!\n
	+ All of the local Piantas\n
	+ and Nokis just love to\n
	+ have festivals here!\n
     2 [/6f] = What's that?\n
	+ A festival? All right!\n
	+ Let's get down!
     3 [/27] = Those large-billed\n
	+ Cataquacks tend to\n
	+ be very territorial.\n
	+ So, when they spot\n
	+ an outsider such as\n
	+ yourself, they go wild!\n
	+ They'll run up and hurl\n
	+ you into the air, but\n
	+ they mean no harm.
     4 [/30] = Watch out for the red\n
	+ Cataquacks! Seriously!\n
	+ They can hurt you.\n
	+ They only appeared\n
	+ on this beach recently.
     5	= Hey, you! Don't get\n
	+ the water dirty here!\n
	+ \n
	+ And don't step on\n
	+ the \z{7ff,400}Du\z{7ff,400}ne Buds\z{7ff,0}! \z{7ff,0}\n
	+ \n
	+ Thanks for your\n
	+ cooperation!
     6 [/26] = The legendary giant\n
	+ Sand Bird will soon\n
	+ hatch from its egg.\n
	+ That's what the\n
	+ professor studying the\n
	+ Shine Tower said...
     7 [/5e] = Hey, mister! A coin fell\n
	+ under the floorboards\n
	+ of this hut.\n
	+ If you're under there\n
	+ and can't see well, try\n
	+ pressing the Y Button.
     8	= Hey, do you see the\n
	+ jumbo juicer on top\n
	+ of this hut?\n
	+ That's how we make\n
	+ our special\n
	+ juice smoothies.\n
	+ By the way, was\n
	+ anyone out there in\n
	+ the Surf Cabana?\n
	+ Oh, blast it all! The\n
	+ owner must be out\n
	+ walking with her son.
     9 [/3c] = Have you ever heard\n
	+ of the \z{7ff,400}Sand Portal\z{7ff,0}?\n
	+ \n
	+ It's a sand castle that\n
	+ appears, then\n
	+ crumbles away quickly.\n
	+ I guess it must\n
	+ not have a very\n
	+ good foundation...
     a [/14] = This tower enshrines\n
	+ the egg of the\n
	+ legendary Sand Bird.\n
	+ Actually, it not only\n
	+ holds the egg, it\n
	+ also keeps it warm.\n
	+ Which is important,\n
	+ because the egg is\n
	+ living, of course!\n
	+ You did see those\n
	+ gigantic mirrors,\n
	+ didn't you?\n
	+ They gather the sun's\n
	+ rays and reflect them\n
	+ at the tower.\n
	+ They've been doing\n
	+ that for over 100\n
	+ years! Isn't that wild?\n
	+ What's even wilder is\n
	+ that the egg is almost\n
	+ ready to hatch!\n
	+ That's right! The\n
	+ legendary Sand Bird\n
	+ is almost here!\n
	+ Just thinking about\n
	+ witnessing such an\n
	+ event is a thrill!

	+ \n
	+ If no one's here, be\n
