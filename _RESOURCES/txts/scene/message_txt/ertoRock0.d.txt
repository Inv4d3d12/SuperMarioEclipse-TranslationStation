     0	= One moment, my\n
	+ backpack is on fire...\n
	+ \n
	+ The next moment,\n
	+ I'm the one on fire\n
	+ in this crazy lava!\n
	+ Good luck saving\n
	+ the others! Hurry!
     1	= Thanks for saving me!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ You know, I have\n
	+ this tendency to\n
	+ fall in goop...\n
	+ But I was not\n
	+ expecting to fall\n
	+ in lava goop!
     2	= I can't believe I\n
	+ got lost in lava\n
	+ this time!\n
	+ At least it wasn't\n
	+ someplace high\n
	+ up and scary!...
     3	= I was just passing\n

	+ done for mister!
     5	= I was just trying\n
	+ to get more food\n
	+ from my storage shed!\n
	+ Now it's all burnt,\n
	+ and I'll have to\n
	+ buy more stock...
     6	= When I saw the\n
	+ mini-eruption shoot\n
	+ from the side vents...\n
	+ I figured staying up\n
	+ high would keep\n
	+ me safe!...\n
	+ Who could have\n
	+ guessed the lava\n
	+ would reach here?
     7	= My beautiful\n
	+ mustache! My\n
	+ gorgeous glasses!\n
	+ Oh well, at least\n
	+ you saved me.
     8	= Honestly, the peppers\n
	+ I sell have more kick\n
	+ than this lava.
     9	= Man, that lava\n
	+ was a real doozy!\n
	+ Thanks for helping me!
     a	= 10
     b	= I'm glad everyone\n

	+ more goop!...
     d	= Man, if I got lost\n

	+ would save me!
     e	= I'm going to tell my\n
	+ mom all about this\n
	+ when I get home!
     f	= This makes me\n
	+ wonder why we live\n
	+ on an active volcano?
    10	= I guess it isn't so\n
	+ bad. At least\n
	+ everyone is safe!
    11	= Honestly, now that\n
	+ everyone is safe...\n
	+ \n
	+ The whole thing\n
	+ is pretty funny!
    12	= I'll just wear a\n
	+ fake mustache!\n
	+ That'll fix it up!
    13	= Hey, now that the\n
	+ conflict is resolved...\n
	+ \n
	+ You should try the\n
	+ peppers! They are\n
	+ really hot!
    14	= Well, guess it's\n
	+ time for me to\n
	+ be on my way!
    15	= 10 pt2
    16	= Whuzza- wha-\n
	+ what do I do? Oh!\n

	+ horrible tragedy!\n
	+ The townsfolk were\n
	+ covered in lava from\n
	+ Corona Mountain!\n
	+ It was a spectacle,\n
	+ truly shocking! I\n
	+ tried to clean it up...\n
	+ But quickly realized\n
	+ it was too much\n
	+ for me to handle.\n
	+ I see you have\n
	+ that \z{7ff,400}water pump\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ looking thing!\n
	+ Can you use it to\n
	+ save the townsfolk\n
	+ before it's too late?\n
	+ Hurry! They can\n
	+ only last so long!
    17	= Why are you\n
	+ hesitating? I made a\n
	+ mistake didn't I?
    18	= You did it? Thank\n
	+ the Sprites, I thought\n
	+ they were goners!\n
	+ Take this \z{7ff,400}reward\z{7ff,0} as\n
	+ a token of my\n
	+ appreciation!
    19	= This whole event\n
	+ is gonna leave me\n
	+ traumatized!...
