     0	= Ah, hello good sir!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I see more travelers\n
	+ are beginning to find\n
	+ this humble island.\n
	+ The breeze is so lovely\n
	+ here... I wonder what\n
	+ we should call it?
     1	= There are so many\n
	+ new visitors arriving\n
	+ each day!\n
	+ I'm setting up a\n
	+ merchantile in hopes\n
	+ of expanding the town.\n
	+ Need anything while\n
	+ you're here?\n
	+ \n
	+ Red coins, hm?\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Sorry, sir. We receive\n
	+ the money- we don't\n
	+ give it away, haha!
     2	= Whee! It's so much\n
	+ fun hiding in the\n
	+ flowers!\n
	+ I wonder if my friends\n
	+ will come looking\n
	+ for me?
     3	= I'm kinda the deputy\n
	+ 'round these parts.\n
	+ \n
	+ Huh? Why am I in jail?\n
	+ Besides the ghost,\n
	+ you mean?\n
	+ Well, I'm just a kid...\n
	+ I couldn't help it,\n
	+ really!\n
	+ I stole a\n
	+ chocolate bar.\n
	+ \n
	+ So I did the right thing\n
	+ and turned myself in.\n
	+ Hahaha!
     4	= Alright girls, enough\n
	+ standing around.\n
	+ \n
	+ It's time to take up\n
	+ our four swords and\n
	+ protect our new home!
     5	= Let's not be hasty,\n
	+ now. We want to help\n
	+ people, not harm them.
     6	= Yeah, that's the spirit!
     7	= Hey there stranger!\n
	+ If you bring me\z{7ff,500} 30\n
	+ Rupee\z{7ff,0} ill sell you\n
	+ one of those fancy\n
	+ \z{7ff,200}red ones\z{7ff,0} at a huge\n
	+ discount, my friend.\n
	+ Hope to see you again!
     8	= I think the lookout\n
	+ tower here could make\n
	+ for a nice windmill.
     9	= It looks like an old\n
	+ bomb shop once\n
	+ stood here.
     a	= 10
     b	= I don't think we have\n
	+ use for such a thing.\n
	+ \n
	+ But perhaps we can\n
	+ repurpose it?\n
	+ \n
	+ Do you think coconuts\n
	+ would be a better\n
	+ alternative?
     c	= 12
     d	= 13
     e	= I've invited my pals\n
	+ to come visit this\n
	+ remote island.\n
	+ We're gonna explore\n
	+ the maze underground\n
	+ and look for treasure!
     f	= I hear there's treasure\n
	+ in the maze behind the\n
	+ jail underground.\n
	+ I'm sure something\n
	+ nifty awaits whoever\n
	+ reaches the end.\n
	+ But I wonder if there's\n
	+ something hiding in\n
	+ the maze itself?\n
	+ Keep a sharp eye out\n
	+ mister, and watch\n
	+ your step!
    10	= 16
    11	= Eeee, this will be so\n
	+ much fun! We're gonna\n
	+ help so many people!
    12	= Just tell me\n
	+ where to find those\n
	+ ne'er-do-wells!\n
	+ I'll knock 'em down\n
	+ one by one!
    13	= Doot dee doo!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I love playing music\n
	+ as a friendly gale\n
	+ billows by.\n
	+ I wish I had a partner\n
	+ to wake the wind with.
    14	= do you want coin?\n
