	+ Have you tried the\n
	+ Yoshi-Go-Round?\n
	+ Hmmm?! Not enough\n
	+ Yoshis, you say?\n
	+ What do you...\n
	+ Oh, yeah! The orange\n
	+ one broke! I forgot\n
	+ about that!\n
	+ We lacked the funds\n
	+ to fix it, so we just\n
	+ took it off...
     1	= This is the\n
	+ Yoshi-Go-Round!\n
	+ Know about Yoshis?\n
	+ They used to roam\n
	+ this island freely, but\n

	+ Now that you mention\n
	+ it, I did see an egg!
     4	= Yoshis are born from\n
	+ eggs. Yes! Eggs just\n
	+ like these!
     5	= Just to be sure, we're\n
	+ going to keep testing\n
	+ this one for a while...
     6	= What the...?\n
	+ What's with this egg?
     7	= I heard someone\n
	+ found a Yoshi egg!\n
	+ Where is it?
     8	= Well...\n
	+ Maybe this one is\n
	+ OK now...
     9	= We're currently doing\n
	+ test runs on this ride.\n
	+ Sorry, but come again!
     a	= Hey, Dad! Let's ride\n
	+ the Yoshi Egg!\n
	+ Come on!!
     b	= Whuh-whuh-WAAAA!\n
	+ Someone's found a\n
