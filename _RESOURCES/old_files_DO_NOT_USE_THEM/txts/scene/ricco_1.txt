     0	= You know, there sure\n
	+ are some odd folks\n
	+ out there...\n
	+ Taming little Bloopers\n
	+ is bizarre enough, but\n
	+ riding on their backs?\n
	+ I tell you, some folks\n
	+ are just plain looney!
     1	= That guy on the pier?\n
	+ He's the Big Daddy\n
	+ of Blooper-surfing.\n
	+ That's nothing to\n
	+ sneeze at, I'll tell\n
	+ you that much!\n
	+ Me? No, I do NOT\n
	+ ride Bloopers!\n
	+ No, thank you!
     2	= \z{600,1}You want to head for\n
	+ shore? All right by\n
	+ me! Woooooooooo!!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     3	= You know, some day...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I'll toss people\n
	+ around just like my\n
	+ big bro! You'll see!
     4	= I am just pleased as\n
	+ punch that that big,\n
	+ nasty Blooper's gone!
     5	= Even though that big\n
	+ Blooper's gone, the\n
	+ water's still a mess!
     6	= Where is that goop\n
	+ coming from?
     7	= I heard that there's\n
	+ Blooper-surfing\n
	+ around here.\n
	+ Do you know where?
     8	= That's right!\n
	+ I'm the Big Daddy of\n
	+ Blooper-surfing!\n
	+ You like surfing?\n
	+ Hop on a Blooper and\n
	+ give it a whirl!\n
	+ Oh, but one thing!\n
	+ Big Daddy waives all\n
	+ liability for accidents.\n
	+ Now, hang loose, bud!
     9	= The deck is the very\n
	+ life of the ship,\n
	+ my landlubbing pal!\n
	+ That's why we polish\n
	+ her to a glowing\n
	+ shine every day!
     a	= If the deck is dirty,\n
	+ a sailor might as well\n
	+ hang up his cap!\n
	+ That's just the life\n
	+ of a fellow at sea,\n
	+ my friend!\n
	+ And hey, watch it with\n
	+ those dirty clompers!
