     0	= You look like you're\n
	+ ready! The gunk in the\n
	+ ocean is caused by...\n
	+ A giant eel! It's \n
	+ moved into our\n
	+ ancestral home...\n
	+ ...at the sea floor,\n
	+ and it's nursing some\n
	+ nasty cavities there.\n
	+ Let's take a look...
     1	= The newly uncorked\n
	+ waterfall created a\n
	+ gap in the pollution...\n
	+ ...that you can use\n
	+ as an entrance!\n
	+ Jump right in there!\n
	+ Dive to the bottom of\n
	+ the ocean and clean\n
	+ that eel's teeth!\n
	+ Doing so will ease his\n
	+ pain, and he'll return\n
	+ from whence he came!\n
	+ No doubt about it!\n
	+ Now, gather your\n
	+ courage and DIVE!
     2	= Well, why not dive in?
     3	= Oh, Mario! You're\n
	+ finally setting out for\n
	+ the ocean's bottom!\n
	+ Grandpa is waiting for\n
	+ you up top. Oh, don't\n
	+ forget to wear this...
     4	= You can use this rope\n
	+ as a shortcut to\n
	+ reach Grandpa...
     5	= Please help us!
     6	= I owe you, Mario!\n
	+ Now, my business is\n
	+ up and running again!\n
	+ Please, use my boats\n
	+ for free anytime you\n
	+ so desire, yes?\n
	+ I don't have any oars,\n
	+ though, so you'll have\n
	+ to use your FLUDD!
