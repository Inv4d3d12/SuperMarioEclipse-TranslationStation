     1	= Aaauuugh!! This dish\n
	+ is on the brink of\n
	+ crisping over...\n
	+ I haven't got the right\n
	+ ingredient to finish\n
	+ the meal!\n
	+ If only I had\n
	+ something \z{7ff,200}spicy\z{7ff,0}...
     2	= ...Can you please\n
	+ leave the piano alone?
     3	= I'm glad you're\n

	+ this trip.
     4	= I didn't know we sold\n
	+ pizza here...
     5	= I think my food is...\n
	+ slightly undercooked,\n
	+ heh-heh.\n
	+ Mind passing the word\n
	+ along to the chef?\n
	+ \n
	+ He did seem a little\n
	+ stressed out, now that\n
	+ I think about it.
     6	= ...I think I like working\n
	+ for that new guy over\n
	+ Short Stuff.\n
	+ I actually get to make\n
	+ fun food, like pizza!\n
	+ \n
	+ I wonder what else he\n
	+ does on the side?
     7	= Listen to the way\n
	+ she plays...\n
	+ \n
	+ Lonely, isn't it?\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ I know I could be a\n
	+ good partner for her.\n
	+ \n
	+ But she never seems\n
	+ to have the time.\n
	+ \n
	+ I just want to see\n
	+ her smile.
     8	= The men in black\n
	+ try to cramp my style,\n
	+ but I fear no one!\n
	+ ...Still, better to be\n
	+ safe than sorry.\n
	+ \n
	+ I've got a challenge\n
	+ for you, but you'll\n
	+ have to wait.\n
	+ Come back once those\n
	+ bullies are humbled\n
	+ and we can play!
     9	= Heh, Boss is fond of\n

     c	= Don't ask.
     d	= There's a \z{7ff,400}Shine Sprite\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ locked in my room.\n
	+ \n
	+ Can you hear it\n
	+ twinkling?\n
	+ \n
	+ I lost my key and\n
	+ the staff can't find\n
	+ the spares anywhere.\n
	+ Maybe you can get\n
	+ in through the fire\n
	+ escape in the back?
     e	= There's a ghastly\n
	+ draft coming through\n
	+ that vent.\n
	+ I can almost hear\n
	+ music through it...!\n
	+ \n
	+ No, not the piano\n
	+ downstairs. It sounds\n
	+ like... \z{7ff,500}a-capella\z{7ff,0}.
     f	= Do I smell pizza?
    10	= My best friend and I\n
	+ are touring the island\n
	+ together!\n
	+ She'll be arriving\n

	+ It's the party life\n
	+ for us! Whee-hee!
    11	= Wahoooo!! So many\n
	+ great games to play-\n
	+ I can't decide!\n

	+ It looks like it could\n
	+ \z{7ff,500}suck you right in\z{7ff,0}!
    12	= Hey you! This puny\n
	+ chef isn't gonna\n
	+ cut it.\n
	+ So I've decided to\n
	+ sell pizzas instead!\n
	+ \n
	+ I need you to go\n
	+ deliver them all,\n
	+ you hear me?\n
	+ The faster you deliver\n
	+ each pizza, the better\n
	+ the tip you'll receive.\n
	+ Don't slack off, buster!\n
	+ I'm watching the clock!
    13	= You have \z{7ff,200}2:30\z{7ff,0} to\n
	+ deliver everything.\n

	+ uh, I mean, hotel's\n
	+ nightly profits!\n
	+ What do you mean,\n
	+ "you thought these\n
	+ tips were yours"?\n
	+ This is what you\n
	+ actually earned...
    16	= Huh? You ungrateful\n
	+ snob! You wanted\n
	+ more than that?\n
	+ ...Fine, whatever. I\n
	+ guess I can give you\n
	+ this tiny bonus.
    17	= Get outta here- we\n
	+ don't offer worker's\n
	+ comp to volunteers.
    18	= Aww, I was really\n
	+ counting on getting a\n
	+ hot pizza too...

	+ of the night has been\n
	+ alright.

	+ a perfect date.
    1c	= Aw man... First my\n
	+ pepper wasn't fully\n

	+ truly sorry. Thanks!
    20	= Well! That's the last\n
	+ time I order pizza\n
	+ from this hotel.\n
	+ Room temperature?\n
	+ No thanks.
    21	= Ahh... thank you. I\n
	+ was quite famished!
    22	= I was hoping to\n
	+ surprise my friend\n
	+ with some good pizza.\n
	+ But now it's cold...\n
	+ I suppose we'll snack\n
	+ on popcorn instead.
    23	= Oh, bellissimo! My\n
	+ friend just arrived and\n
	+ now we have pizza!\n
