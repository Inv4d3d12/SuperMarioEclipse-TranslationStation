     0	= Why, hello good sir!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Please don't give me\n
	+ away, I know that\n
	+ girl can't find me here!
     1	= After eating those\n
	+ flamin' hot peppers...\n
	+ \n
	+ I'm simply too fast\n
	+ to get tagged now!
     2	= I considered hiding\n
	+ in the goop I keep\n
	+ falling into...\n
	+ But this crevice\n
	+ will have to do!
     3	= Do you think if\n
	+ I set my backpack\n
	+ on fire...\n
	+ That she would\n
	+ be too afraid\n
	+ to tag me? Haha!
     4	= This signpost\n
	+ perfectly hides me!
     5	= No one knows this\n
	+ cliff better than me!
     6	= Who could have\n
	+ guessed I would\n
	+ choose to hide here?\n
	+ At first I was\n
	+ scared of heights,\n
	+ now I love them!
     7	= Hiding in this corner\n
	+ is the perfect spot.\n
	+ She'll never find me!
     8	= She won't be able\n
	+ to tag me, she'll\n
	+ slip on this water!
     9	= I wanted to run\n
	+ further away...\n
	+ \n
	+ But everyone else\n
	+ is playing too\n
	+ seriously for her.
     a	= What? I thought a\n
	+ blue coin was a\n
	+ great reward!\n
	+ Shine Sprites don't\n
	+ just grow on trees\n
	+ you know...

    10	= Wait, you're it?\n
	+ Darn, I was so sure\n
	+ this would work!
    11	= Aw man, I guess\n
	+ even after eating\n
	+ those hot peppers...\n
	+ I just couldn't take\n
	+ the heat. How ironic!
    12	= Wow, you're the\n
	+ person tagging?\n
	+ \n
	+ I thought it\n
	+ was that girl!\n
	+ Hmmph!
    13	= Aw shucks, I\n
	+ should've set\n
	+ myself on fire!\n
	+ Then you wouldn't\n
	+ have been able\n
	+ to tag me! yes!
    14	= What? I thought\n
	+ the girl was tagging\n
	+ us?... Oh well.
    15	= How could you tag\n
	+ me? I know this cliff\n
	+ too well for that!
    16	= Honestly, I'm not\n
	+ surprised that she\n
	+ would make you tag!\n
	+ You are very\n
	+ athletic after all!
    17	= Man, I thought she\n
	+ was tagging! Good\n
	+ job nonetheless!
    18	= This isn't fair! She\n
	+ was supposed to be\n
	+ it! You are too good!
    19	= Wait, what's the\n
	+ point of going easy\n
	+ if you are it?...\n
	+ Oh well, at least\n
	+ she got to win!
    1a	= Ah! You caught me!
    1b	= What?? No fair!
    1c	= Dang, you caught\n
	+ me so easily!
    1d	= Huh? Why did you\n
	+ tag me? Oh, you\n
	+ are it? Hm...
    1e	= Sniff... hey, mister.\n
	+ I'm not having fun\n
	+ playing tag right now.\n
	+ You see, they made\n
	+ me be \z{7ff,200}it\z{7ff,0}, but I'm\n
	+ just a kid!\n
	+ They don't even\n
	+ go easy on me...\n
	+ \n
	+ ...\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ \z{7ff,200}TAG! YOU'RE IT!\z{7ff,0}\n
	+ I'm done playing, but\n
	+ try to tag the others!
    1f	= Like I said, I'm not\n
	+ playing. Go tag other\n
	+ people silly!
    20	= Wow, you really\n
	+ tagged them all!\n
	+ You are amazing!
