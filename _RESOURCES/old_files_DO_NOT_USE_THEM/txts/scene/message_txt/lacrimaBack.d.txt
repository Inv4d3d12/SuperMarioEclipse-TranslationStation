     0	= Da boss says you're\n
	+ cool with us now.
     1	= Don't worry about\n
	+ what's inside the\n
	+ crates.\n
	+ The big man doesn't\n
	+ even want us to know.
     2	= I had a wife and kids,\n
	+ you know.\n
	+ \n
	+ I wonder if they're\n
	+ still doing ok...
     3	= I hear ya took down\n
	+ all of our stus! Izzat\n
	+ true?
     4	= Hey! How'd you get\n
	+ up here so fast??\n
	+ \n
	+ Teach me to jump\n
	+ like that, wa-ha!
     5	= It's a rough job...\n
	+ but it pays well.
     6	= Sometimes I wonder\n
	+ if I'm really cut out\n
	+ for all this.\n
	+ But I can't just walk\n
	+ away now. I'm in this\n
	+ for keeps.
     7	= Is there a particular\n
	+ reason ya keep comin'\n
	+ down here, ya creep?
     8	= You beat our stus\n
	+ pretty darn good\n
	+ last time.\n
	+ So we're training\n
	+ some new recruits!\n
	+ Heh-heh!
     9	= Honestly I'm surprised\n
	+ no one upstairs has\n
	+ noticed our presence.\n
	+ ...Or maybe they have,\n
	+ and are just too afraid\n
	+ to speak up- ha!\n
	+ The Delfino Police\n
	+ won't even touch us.\n
	+ \n
	+ In fact, and I can't\n
	+ verify this rumor...\n
	+ \n
	+ But I've heard whispers\n
	+ that Big Man pays\n
	+ them off.
     a	= Is it bad to confess\n
	+ that you intimidate\n
	+ me?
     b	= I hope our other stus\n
	+ recover well.\n
	+ \n
	+ They weren't just\n
	+ fighters, you know.\n
	+ \n
	+ We consider them\n
	+ pets and friends too.
     c	= That big guy down\n
	+ there is a rare stu\n
	+ species.\n
	+ They can only be\n
	+ found deep in the\n
	+ Pianta Village pit.\n
	+ If you ever go down\n
	+ there, I hope you can\n
	+ find a way back out!\n
	+ Ha-ha!
     d	= Hah! Thanks to you,\n
	+ I won the wager!
     e	= Da big boss sure has\n
	+ an affinity for stus.\n
	+ \n
	+ Word underground is\n
	+ he's specially breedin'\n
	+ a champion fighter.\n
	+ But I dunno... I think\n
	+ he just wants a big\n
	+ one to cuddle with.
