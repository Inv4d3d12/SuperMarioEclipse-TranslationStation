     0	= Ahhh, welcome!\n
	+ Master Mario,\n
	+ I presume?\n
	+ We have heard much\n
	+ about you! Yes, and\n
	+ all of it good!\n
	+ As for me, I am just\n
	+ an old man who loves\n
	+ nothing but fishing.\n
	+ But lately, I have had\n
	+ a terrible problem...\n
	+ Please look up there.
     1	= I don't know who\n
	+ did it, but someone\n
	+ corked our waterfall!\n
	+ This, no doubt, is why\n
	+ our lovely bay has\n
	+ become polluted!\n
	+ And I can't even fish!\n
	+ And so, I ask for your\n
	+ help. Yank that cork!\n
	+ Please fulfill this old\n
	+ man's wish... COUGH!\n
	+ HACKPTH! HACKPTH!\n
	+ What's that? You'll\n
	+ do it?! Oh, thank you!\n
	+ Thank you so much!\n
	+ I knew I could count\n
	+ on you. Just beware\n
	+ that guy on the cork!
     2	= And on the way, do\n
	+ you mind cleaning up\n
	+ that graffiti? Thanks!\n
	+ Hyo ho ho ho!
     3	= Oh, are you Mario!?\n
	+ That guy down there's\n
	+ my teacher...\n
	+ I mean, my grandpa!\n
	+ Heh heh! That cork is\n
	+ farther up ahead...\n
	+ Be careful, though!\n
	+ There's a weird guy\n
	+ perched on top of it.\n
	+ He'll start tossing\n
	+ explosives at you\n
	+ if you get too close!\n
	+ I thought you might\n
	+ need help, so I got\n
	+ you this springboard.\n
	+ If you spray it, it'll\n
	+ shrink and be easy to\n
	+ carry. Please use it!
     4	= Oh, greetings!\n
	+ I live here and rent\n
	+ boats usually, but...\n
	+ All my boats washed\n
	+ away, so I'm having a\n
	+ rough time of it now...
     5	= M U D B O A T \n

	+ -90,000 COINS-\n
	+ Mudboats Are Fun!\n
	+ Come Aboard!\n
