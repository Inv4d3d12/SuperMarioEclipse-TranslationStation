     0	= Hey, mister!\n
	+ Think you could spare\n
	+ us a hand, here?\n
	+ This dear lady's pets\n
	+ have decided to go on\n
	+ a little rampage.\n
	+ No, not the bees.\n
	+ They seem to be\n
	+ acting normal.
     1	= Oh my goodness!\n
	+ This is awful!\n
	+ Completely awful!\n
	+ My little darlings have\n
	+ nasty fevers and it's\n
	+ driving them mad!\n
	+ Normally, I grab their\n
	+ tails and spike them\n
	+ into the ground...\n
	+ ...but they're too\n
	+ hot to touch now!\n
	+ Ooh! It burns me up!
     2	= The full moon looks\n
	+ so delicious...\n
	+ Mmmmmm...
     3	= Whoa! Look out!\n
	+ Touch that goop, and\n
	+ you'll get burnt!
     4	= I really want to run\n
	+ around in a more\n
	+ wide-open area.
     5	= Oh, I'm so sorry!\n
	+ Pianta Hot Spring\n
	+ isn't open at night.\n
	+ Come back and try\n
	+ again during daylight\n
	+ hours, all right?\n
	+ Thanks. Bye!\n
     6	= The hot spring is\n
	+ only open during\n
	+ the daytime. Sorry!
     7	= At midday, we direct\n
	+ the water here and\n
	+ heat it up. Ahhhhhh!
     8	= Danger! Danger!
     9	= The underside world\n
	+ has fungi beyond\n
	+ compare. Truly!\n
	+ There are some\n
	+ enormous mushrooms\n
	+ growing down there.
     a	= Gotta clean every day,\n
	+ or things get slippery\n
	+ and dangerous!
     b	= Did you talk to the\n
	+ Pianta at the entrance\n
	+ to our village?\n
	+ Summing up all the\n
	+ trouble here is a\n
	+ really tough job.
     c	= How hot is it?
     d	= That spring is empty\n
	+ during the day,\n
	+ you know.
     e	= Today's youngsters\n
	+ have no interest in\n
	+ the underside. Kids!
     f	= Whoa! You found me!
    10	= Are the Chain \n
	+ Chomplets all calmed\n
	+ down yet?
    11	= Chain Chomplets? I've\n
	+ no time for them!
    12	= I want a pet, too.
    13	= I'm just here to make\n
	+ sure no one runs off\n
	+ with this fruit.\n
	+ You can take some if\n
	+ you need it, though.\n
	+ It'll grow back soon.
    14	= Aaaah! So comfy.\n
	+ So nice. So relaxing.\n
	+ This is coooool!\n
	+ This spring always\n
	+ hits the spot. It's\n
	+ completely refreshing.\n
	+ No better place to\n
	+ cool down than\n
	+ right here. Yep.
    15	= No! No! No! This is\n
	+ what happens to pets\n
	+ without discipline.
    16	= Gramps is just\n
	+ so slow...\n
	+ \n
	+ He left for the spring\n
	+ ages ago, and he\n
	+ hasn't returned.\n
	+ Not that it's weird.\n
	+ He pretty much does\n
	+ that every night.\n
	+ Where's the spring?\n
	+ Center of the village,\n
	+ base of the big tree.
    17	= What do you want?\n
	+ Would you just stay\n
	+ out of my way?
    18	= We have NOTHING to\n
	+ do with those crazy\n
	+ Chain Chomplets!\n
	+ So...leave...us...alone!\n
	+ You got that, mister?
    19	= To tell the truth, the\n
	+ old gal bugs everyone\n
	+ around here.\n
	+ Don't mention her\n
	+ pets, though, or\n
	+ she'll let you have it!\n
	+ That's why no one\n
	+ around here wants to\n
	+ talk to her.
    1a	= I wonder how long I\n
	+ have to stay here...\n
	+ I'm getting hungry.
