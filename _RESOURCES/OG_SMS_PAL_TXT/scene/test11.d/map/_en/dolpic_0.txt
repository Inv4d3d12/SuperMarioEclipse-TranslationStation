     0	= Oh, Mario! You're\n
	+ OK after all! I just\n
	+ knew you would be!
     1	= Well, I'm pleased\n
	+ to see you're safe!\n
	+ I must tell you...\n
	+ We were walking\n
	+ around town earlier,\n
	+ and...\n
	+ ...it seems the area\n
	+ near the \z{7ff,400}Shine Gate\z{7ff,100}\n
	+ is \z{7ff,100}still quite bright...\n
	+ Perhaps you should\n
	+ check it out,\n
	+ Master Mario...
     2	= Waah! You're safe!\n
	+ What a relief! This\n
	+ vacation is crazy! \n
	+ The princess is\n
	+ waiting for you\n
	+ just up ahead.
     3	= Oh, Mario!\n
	+ Why is the weather\n
	+ so strange?
     4	= Everyone on this\n
	+ isle loves to do\n
	+ the "box-breaker"!\n
	+ Just jump up and\n
	+ press < above\n
	+ a box!\n
	+ Ka-SMASH!\n
	+ Why don't you give\n
	+ it a try?
     5	= Everything just went\n
	+ dark, and I thought,\n
	+ "I'm done for..."
     6	= Not this way!\n
	+ Go to the town\n
	+ square! Hurry!
     7	= Get started by\n
	+ cleaning up\n
	+ Bianco Square!\n
	+ Honestly! How could\n
	+ anyone do so much\n
	+ graffiti so quickly?
     8	= Get going! Clean up\n
	+ Bianco Square, and\n
	+ make it snappy!\n
	+ I swear! Graffiti\n
	+ artists just make\n
	+ me so MAD!
     9	= What's this, now?\n
	+ That mustache!\n
	+ That red cap!\n
	+ You look just like\n
	+ the villain in the\n
	+ wanted posters!\n
	+ You cad! You're the\n
	+ one writing "M" on\n
	+ all the walls!\n
	+ You listen to me...\n
	+ Clean it all up!\n
	+ Now, hooligan!
     a	= Hey! If it isn't the\n
	+ bad mustache-man!\n
	+ \n
	+ Just because you're\n
	+ cleaning up the\n
	+ town...\n
	+ ...that doesn't mean\n
	+ you're clean with me!
     b	= Well, if it isn't the\n
	+ scribble-doodle man\n
	+ himself!! You jerk!\n
	+ What in the world\n
	+ are you thinking\n
	+ with this nonsense?!\n
	+ This stuff is no\n
	+ joke, you know!\n
	+ Now, clean it up!
     c	= The ones on the\n
	+ right are durians...\n
	+ \n
	+ And the ones on the\n
	+ left are coconuts.\n
	+ \n
	+ If you're not\n
	+ buying, get lost!
     d	= In the hot sun, you\n
	+ need something even\n
	+ hotter to cool off!\n
	+ Try these fresh red\n
	+ peppers! ...Oh, who\n
	+ am I kidding?\n
	+ In this haze, these\n
	+ peppers look totally\n
	+ unappetizing!
     e	= I just heard a yell\n
	+ from the square!\n
	+ What happened?!
     f	= This is so amazing,\n
	+ isn't it? Where are\n
	+ the TV cameras? \n
	+ Oh, wait! Is it over\n
	+ already? Did I miss\n
	+ something? Huh?
    10	= This is the place,\n
	+ all right...\n
	+ Bianco Square!\n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ there's a statue of\n
	+ the Grand Pianta...\n
	+ So, where'd it go?
    11	= I came all the way\n
	+ here from Pianta\n
	+ Village on vacation...\n
	+ And this is awful!\n
	+ I guess all cities\n
	+ really ARE dirty...
    12	= Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    13	= So it's true... Our\n
	+ Shine Sprites really\n
	+ have left us...\n
	+ I'm taking it\n
	+ pretty hard, to tell\n
	+ you the truth.\n
	+ I just wish the sun\n
	+ would return and\n
	+ tan us like before!
    14	= Well, hello there!\n
	+ I'm what you might\n
	+ call the crate guy!\n
	+ The crates come in\n
	+ off the boats, and\n
	+ I deal with 'em.\n
	+ You look like you\n
	+ could deal with a\n
	+ few crates yourself!\n
	+ If you've got free\n
	+ time, why don't you\n
	+ try bashing some?\n
    15	= Hey there! You\n
	+ don't look so good.\n
	+ It's like, well...\n
	+ It's like disaster is\n
	+ written all over your\n
	+ face, you know?\n
	+ What's that?! We're\n
	+ already having a\n
	+ disaster?! Oh...right!
    16	= We're in a tight\n
	+ spot, and that's\n
	+ for sure!\n
	+ I'm telling you,\n
	+ this place will be\n
	+ pitch-black soon!
    17	= I guess it's true\n
	+ about all the Shine\n
	+ Sprites leaving...
    18	= Hm? Naw, the boat\n
	+ can't leave yet. You\n
	+ have to improvise!
    19	= And why is the sky\n
	+ so dark, huh? It's\n
	+ not sun-drenched!\n
	+ This is hardly my\n
	+ idea of a relaxing\n
	+ vacation, Mario.\n
	+ I want to go home\n
	+ right now!
    1a	= These repairs are\n
	+ really rough, I'm\n
	+ telling you!\n
	+ It'll be a while...
    1b	= THE CRATE GUY\n
	+ \n
	+ ---CLOSED---\n
	+ \n
	+ Test your skill\n
	+ another time.\n
    1c	=   BOATHOUSE\n
	+ \n
	+  ---CLOSED---\n
	+ \n
	+ Please come again.\n
    1d	= Well well well! If it\n
	+ isn't you! You have\n
	+ that tourist map?\n
	+ Did I tell you to\n
	+ press $ to view\n
	+ that thing?
    1e	= I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
