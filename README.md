## **About the Project**
This repository is a community translation project for **Super Mario Eclipse**, a modification of Super Mario Sunshine. It contains all important message files from the game and also texture dumps for the graphical texts. We would like to translate the message files so that the game is not only available in english, but also in the languages represented here in the repo.

To collaborate on this project, you will need certain tools that will make it easier for you to edit the files. Here are some useful tools:

- [Switch-Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox) for extracting the `.iso` and for editing/searching certain files
- [SMS Message Editor](https://github.com/JoshuaMKW/SMS-Message-Editor) for editing `.bmg` files with ingame view
- [Wiimms SZS Toolset](https://szs.wiimm.de/) for extracting `.szs` files, converting `.bmg` into `.txt` and `.txt` back into `.bmg`
- [SMS Modding Wiki](https://smswiki.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Docs)
- For translators, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16SODPmaqB_A6rrQJlQv6CGCsJy6uu63B0eXsxvo3BuU/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to idioms and other localization things from the English script
