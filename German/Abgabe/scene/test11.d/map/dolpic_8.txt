     8 [/16] = This darkness makes\n

     d [/4c] = Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n

	+ Are all cities dark?
    10 [/25] = Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    11 [/1d] = Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    12 [/16] = I still wish the sun\n

	+ in there and cover\n
	+ your ears!
    18 [/14] = I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
    19 [/84] = Darn! And I was\n
	+ just about to ride\n
	+ that Yoshi, too!
    1a [/84] = Rats! And I was\n
	+ just about to\n
	+ turbo-dash, too!
    1b [/84] = Shoot! And I was\n
