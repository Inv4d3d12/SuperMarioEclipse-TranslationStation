     0 [/27] = I'll have you know\n
	+ that if you use the\n
	+ Dune Buds wisely...\n
	+ ...you can reach\n
	+ heights you never\n
	+ would normally.\n
	+ You know, like the\n
	+ tops of huts and\n
	+ places like that...
     1 [/30] = We need to get those\n

	+ need to do to save\n
	+ the egg:\n
	+ We need to get that\n
	+ big green caterpillar\n

	+ To do that, we need\n
	+ to move the mirrors\n
	+ back into position.\n
	+ So, we need to get\n
	+ rid of those Plungelos\n
	+ that are up there!\n
	+ Then the heat from\n

	+ the caterpillar move!\n
	+ Whew! What a plan!

	+ Think that'll do it?
     a [/1c] = I've been observing\n
