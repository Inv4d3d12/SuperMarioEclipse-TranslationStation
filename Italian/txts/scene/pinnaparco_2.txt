     0	= Hey there, Mr. Hero!\n
	+ Have you tried the\n
	+ Ferris Wheel yet?\n
	+ It's a delightful\n
	+ romp! What's that\n
	+ you say, now?\n
	+ Yes, it does seem to\n
	+ be spinning rather\n
	+ excessively. Hmmm...
     1	= This is the\n
	+ Yoshi-Go-Round!\n
	+ Know about Yoshis?\n
	+ They used to roam\n
	+ this island freely, but\n
	+ now, they've gone...
     2	= Look at that! Only the\n
	+ orange Yoshi on the\n
	+ ride disappeared!\n
	+ What does it mean,\n
	+ mister? Huh? Huh?
     3	= A Yoshi egg?!\n
	+ Now that you mention\n
	+ it, I did see an egg!
     4	= Yoshis are born from\n
	+ eggs. Yes! Eggs just\n
	+ like these!
     5	= As you can see, it\n
	+ just spins and spins\n
	+ and spins...\n
	+ Sorry, but this ride is\n
	+ not working well at\n
	+ the moment...
     6	= Aww, no one can ride\n
	+ the Ferris Wheel now!\n
	+ This is so lame!\n
	+ When is it going\n
	+ to be fixed?
     7	= Some weird turtle is\n
	+ doing bad stuff back\n
	+ there! It's crazy!
     8	= Those Electro-Koopas\n
	+ are up to no good!\n
	+ \n
	+ Could you flush them\n
	+ out from back there?\n
	+ Thanks!
     9	= We're currently doing\n
	+ test runs on this ride.\n
	+ Sorry, but come again!
     a	= Wow, I like the Ferris\n
	+ Wheel even better at\n
	+ high speed!\n
	+ Please, can we ride\n
	+ it? PLEASE, DAD!
     b	= Whoooaaaaaa!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ The wheel's out of\n
	+ control! It's just\n
	+ spinning madly!\040
     c	= Hm?! If the Ferris\n
	+ Wheel is spinning that\n
	+ much, then...
     d	= La la la! Lalalalala!\n
	+ I'm Ducky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Hee hee!\n
	+ Clam Cups are the\n
	+ funnest ever!
     e	= La dee la! Dah dah!\n
	+ I'm Plucky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Ha ha!\n
	+ This clam is closed!\n
	+ Is that weird?
     f	= Wah dee dah! Wah!\n
	+ I'm Lucky of the\n
	+ Buckies! Wah ha!\n
	+ Where are all of\n
