     5	= Those pesky spiders!\n
	+ I'll wait in here for\n
	+ them to leave.\n
	+ Say, I just got that\n
	+ new toy over there.\n
	+ \n
	+ You can borrow it\n
	+ if you want. I don't\n
	+ have much use for it.
     6	= Succulent seafood,\n
	+ you say?
     7	= Something about that\n
	+ fire just unsettles me.\n
	+ \n
	+ I guess watching your\n
	+ village burn down will\n
	+ do that to ya.
     8	= I'm not sure I like\n
	+ these spiky fruits.\n
	+ \n
	+ They don't taste good\n
	+ enough for me to get\n
	+ past the awful smell.\n
	+ Do you want it?
     9	= Aren't the clouds\n
	+ rolling by so pretty?\n
	+ \n
	+ Their shadows keep\n
	+ making the beach\n
	+ bright and dark a lot!
     a	= I'm hungry.\n
	+ Got any pizza?\n
	+ \n
	+ What do you mean\n
	+ "Yoshis eat fruit"?\n
	+ \n
	+ I'll eat whatever I like!
     b	= I'm telling ya, they're\n
	+ vegetables, not fruit!\n
	+ \n
	+ They grow in the\n
	+ ground like carrots\n
	+ and potatoes!
     c	= This basin around the\n
	+ Super Happy Tree is\n
	+ full of its magic.\n
	+ As long as the tree is\n
	+ growing, the water\n
	+ flows downstream...\n
	+ ...and the plants in the\n
	+ village never stop\n
	+ bearing fruit!\n
	+ Unlimited fruit\n
	+ for all- truly a\n
	+ Yoshi's paradise.
     d	= Listen, they're fruit!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ They've got seeds,\n
	+ right? Only fruits\n
	+ have those!
     e	= We can spit different\n
	+ kinds of juice based\n
	+ on what food we eat.\n
	+ And then we can make\n
	+ juice blocks that do\n
	+ different things!\n
	+ I always keep these\n
	+ rare peppers on hand\n
	+ exactly for that reason.
     f	= Hooray! Thanks to you,\n
	+ the Super Happy Tree\n
	+ grew back!\n
	+ But now there's a\n
	+ clamber infestation!\n
	+ \n
	+ Can you help us\n
	+ out again?
    10	= I wanted to put up\n
	+ a new front door.\n
	+ \n
	+ I don't think that\n
	+ orange goop was\n
	+ the best idea.
