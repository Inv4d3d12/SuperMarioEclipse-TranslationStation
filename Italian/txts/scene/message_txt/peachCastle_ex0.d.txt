     0	= I was thinking that\n
	+ peace would finally\n
	+ return to the village...\n
	+ But with you still\n
	+ around, I have my\n
	+ doubts...
     1	= You know, it's just\n
	+ like there's one\n
	+ disaster after another.\n
	+ Not that it's your\n
	+ fault or anything...
     2	= This was once a calm\n
	+ place, but now there's\n
	+ way too much hoopla!
     3	= Lately, things just\n
	+ seem really out of\n
	+ balance, you know?
     4	= This may be a bit\n
	+ sudden, but listen\n
	+ and listen good!\n
	+ Let's say you find\n
	+ yourself hanging\n
	+ from a rope...\n
	+ Shoot just a little\n
	+ water, and you'll\n
	+ start to swing, right?\n
	+ Well, if you have good\n
	+ timing, and you do\n
	+ that several times...\n
	+ ...you'll start spinning\n
	+ around the rope. I\n
	+ swear, it's true!\n
	+ Then, if you let loose\n
	+ with a full stream\n
	+ of water...\n
	+ ...you'll gain crazy\n
	+ momentum, which you\n
	+ can use to jump!\n
	+ Yeah! That's what\n
	+ I like to call the\n
	+ Super Whirl Jump!\n
	+ You can go amazingly\n
	+ far with it. Truly.\n
	+ It's incredible!\n
	+ Don't ask me why I\n
	+ know this. I don't\n
	+ really know myself...
     5	= I'm always after those\n
	+ kids to tell me where\n
	+ they're going.\n
	+ But you know they\n
	+ never do! Children are\n
	+ such little hoodlums!\n
	+ Some things just\n
	+ never change!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     6	= I don't even feel safe\n
	+ in the middle of town\n
	+ anymore.\n
	+ But I guess it's better\n
	+ than being alone.
     7	= If there were a club\n
	+ for people who get hit\n
	+ with goop a lot...\n
	+ ...I think I'd have a\n
	+ good shot at being\n
	+ club president.
     8	= I headed over here to\n
	+ check things out, but\n
	+ nothing's happening.\n
	+ Now, I'm just trying to\n
	+ figure out how I'm\n
	+ going to get home...
     9	= \z{600,1}What? Again? You\n
	+ secretly like this,\n
	+ don't you!\n
	+ Raargraar!\z{700,3200} \z{700,0}
     a	= It looks like you've\n
	+ really gotten used to\n
	+ things around here.
     b	= WAAAAUGH!\n
	+ I'm sorry, Mom!\n
	+ \n
	+ Oh, it's just you.
     c	= I'm sorry, mister!\n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ Really, I am.\n
	+ Please don't tell\n
	+ my mother, OK?
     d	= This is the\n
	+ \z{7ff,400}Cliff Spring Cave\z{7ff,0}.\n
	+ \n
	+ And it's...open!\n
	+ Enter, by all means!
     e	= \n
	+ {                 }\n
	+ \n
	+  Ricco          Pinna\n
