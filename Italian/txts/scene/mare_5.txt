     0	= Master Mario, you've\n
	+ become tied to our\n
	+ destiny, I'm afraid.\n
	+ A pathway to another\n
	+ world has opened\n
	+ above our fair land.\n
	+ Surely you will go\n
	+ there? Of course!\n
	+ You must go there!\n
	+ I apologize for\n
	+ involving you in all of\n
	+ this! Good luck!\n
	+ We'll cheer you on\n
	+ from here! Farewell!
     1	= You'll have to use the\n
	+ ropes to climb up\n
	+ there, I'm afraid!
     2	= I owe you, Mario!\n
	+ Now, my business is\n
	+ up and running again!\n
	+ Please, use my boats\n
	+ for free anytime you\n
	+ so desire, yes?\n
	+ I don't have any oars,\n
	+ though, so you'll have\n
	+ to use your FLUDD!
