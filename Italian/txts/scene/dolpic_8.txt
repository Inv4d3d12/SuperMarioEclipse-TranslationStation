     0	= I can't imagine what\n
	+ the poor princess is\n
	+ going through...\n
	+ Mario! Please\n
	+ save her!
     1	= The princess is on\n
	+ that island! I think\n
	+ it's called Pineapple\n
	+ or something...\n
	+ How do you think\n
	+ you can get there?
     2	= Mario! Is the\n
	+ princess OK?
     3	= There seems to be\n
	+ an amusement park\n
	+ on that island...\n
	+ You know, the one\n
	+ that the princess\n
	+ was taken to...
     4	= Horrible! Horrible!\n
	+ Princess Peach has\n
	+ been kidnapped!
     5	= Horrible! Horrible!\n
	+ Princess Peach has\n
	+ been kidnapped!
     6	= Hey! Are you\n
	+ slacking off!?
     7	= And clean up\n
	+ those walls!!\n
	+ Now, slacker!
     8	= This darkness makes\n
	+ me feel so gloomy\n
	+ and depressed...\n
	+ It's been this way\n
	+ ever since our Shine\n
	+ Sprites went away!\n
	+ This is your fault!\n
	+ And you don't even\n
	+ look apologetic!
     9	= It was weird being\n
	+ stuck in that goop.\n
	+ It was gross, but...\n
	+ I gotta admit, it\n
	+ was kind of sweet.\n
	+ Kind of like candy...
     a	= It's your fault that\n
	+ our Shine Sprites left\n
	+ and the sky got dark!
     b	= I thought I told\n
	+ you...\n
	+ NO FREE SAMPLES!!!
     c	= Running around and\n
	+ getting all sweaty\n
	+ is nice, but...\n
	+ You can eat these\n
	+ and get just as\n
	+ sweaty! Yes sir!
     d	= Delicious fruits need\n
	+ the sun to live...\n
	+ At least, ours do.\n
	+ And at this rate,\n
	+ we may never have\n
	+ fruit again.\n
	+ Oh, where have all\n
	+ the Shine Sprites\n
	+ gone off to?!
     e	= What's that?\n
	+ Hold on!\n
	+ I smell it!\n
	+ Something's going to\n
	+ happen! But where?!\n
	+ Where is it?!
     f	= It sure is dark!\n
	+ Is this the daytime?\n
	+ Are all cities dark?
    10	= Now, where's that\n
	+ big ol' Shine?\n
	+ \n
	+ The guidebook says\n
	+ it's like the shining\n
	+ eye of Isle Delfino!
    11	= Unforgivable! I have\n
	+ HAD it! Someone\n
	+ ruined my wall!\n
	+ What does "M"\n
	+ mean, anyway!? And\n
	+ have we met before?
    12	= I still wish the sun\n
	+ would return, but\n
	+ who needs a tan?
    13	= So, you're probably\n
	+ still involved in\n
	+ some naughty stuff...\n
	+ Right? Like huge\n
	+ disasters and stuff?\n
	+ Yup, I knew it!
    14	= I'm telling you, the\n
	+ tree on my head is\n
	+ way taller than yours!
    15	= You're crazy! My tree\n
	+ is much bigger! My\n
	+ leaves are nicer, too!
    16	= The boat's finally\n
	+ moving again!
    17	= You want to go out\n
	+ to that island?\n
	+ \n
	+ All right, then, hop\n
	+ in there and cover\n
	+ your ears!
    18	= I was shipwrecked\n
	+ and washed up here\n
	+ three years ago.\n
	+ I often think about\n
	+ the far shore, but I\n
	+ can't swim...\n
	+ I've never left this\n
	+ little island. Isn't\n
	+ that just awful?
    19	= Darn! And I was\n
	+ just about to ride\n
	+ that Yoshi, too!
    1a	= Rats! And I was\n
	+ just about to\n
	+ turbo-dash, too!
    1b	= Shoot! And I was\n
	+ just about to\n
	+ rocket-jump, too!
